11 Getting Started
32 Biology - The Life Science
The word biology means, "the science of life", from the Greek bios, life, and logos, word
or knowledge. Therefore, Biology is the science of Living Things. That is why Biology is
sometimes known as Life Science.
1
The science has been divided into many subdisciplines, such as botany , bacteriology,
2 3
anatomy , zoology, histology, mycology, embryology, parasitology, genetics , molecular biol-
4 5 6 7
ogy , systematics, immunology, microbiology , physiology, cell biology , cytology, ecology ,
and virology. Other branches of science include or are comprised in part of biology studies,
8
including paleontology , taxonomy, evolution, phycology, helimentology, protozoology, en-
tomology, biochemistry, biophysics, biomathematics, bio engineering, bio climatology and
anthropology.
2.1 Characteristics of life
Not all scientists agree on the deﬁnition of just what makes up life. Various characteristics
describe most living things. However, with most of the characteristics listed below we can
think of one or more examples that would seem to break the rule, with something nonliving
being classiﬁed as living or something living classiﬁed as nonliving. Therefore we are careful
not to be too dogmatic in our attempt to explain which things are living or nonliving.
• Living things are composed of matter structured in an orderly way where simple
molecules are ordered together into much larger macromolecules.
An easy way to remember this is GRIMNERD C All organisms; - Grow, Respire, Interact,
Move, Need Nutrients, Excrete (Waste), Reproduce,Death, Cells (Made of)
• Living things are sensitive, meaning they are able to respond to stimuli.
• Living things are able to grow, develop, and reproduce.
• Living things are able to adapt over time by the process of natural selection.
9
• All known living things use the hereditary molecule, DNA .

5Biology - The Life Science
• Internal functions are coordinated and regulated so that the internal environment of a
10
living thing is relatively constant, referred to as homeostasis .
11
Living things are organized in the microscopic level from atoms up to cells . Atoms are
12 13
arranged into molecules, then into macromolecules , which make up organelles , which
work together to form cells. Beyond this, cells are organized in higher levels to form entire
14
multicellular organisms. Cells together form tissues , which make up organs, which are
part of organ systems, which work together to form an entire organism. Of course, beyond
this, organisms form populations which make up parts of an ecosystem. All of the Earth's
ecosystems together form the diverse environment that is the earth.
Example:-
sub atoms, atoms, molecules, cells, tissues, organs, organ systems, organisms, population,
community, eco systems
2.2 Nature of science
Science is a methodology for learning about the world. It involves the application
of knowledge.
The scientiﬁc method deals with systematic investigation, reproducible results, the
formation and testing of hypotheses, and reasoning.
Reasoning can be broken down into two categories, induction (speciﬁc data is used to
develop a generalized observation or conclusion) and deduction (general information leads
to speciﬁc conclusion). Most reasoning in science is done through induction.
Science as we now know it arose as a discipline in the 17th century.
2.3 Scientiﬁc method
The scientiﬁc method is not a step by step, linear process. It is an intuitive process, a
methodology for learning about the world through the application of knowledge. Scientists
must be able to have an "imaginative preconception" of what the truth is. Scientists will
often observe and then hypothesize the reason why a phenomenon occurred. They use all
of their knowledge and a bit of imagination, all in an attempt to uncover something that
might be true. A typical scientiﬁc investigation might go like so:
You observe that a room appears dark, and you ponder why the room is dark. In an attempt
to ﬁnd explanations to this curiosity, your mind unravels several diﬀerent hypotheses. One
hypothesis might state that the lights are turned oﬀ. Another hunch might be that the
room's lightbulb has burnt out. Worst yet, you could be going blind. To discover the truth,

11 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cell
12 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/macromolecule
13 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/organelle
14 http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/General%20Biology%2FTissues
6Scientiﬁc method
you experiment. You feel your way around the room and ﬁnd a light switch and turn it on.
No light. You repeat the experiment, ﬂicking the switch back and forth. Still nothing. That
means your initial hypothesis, the room is dark because the lights are oﬀ, has been rejected.
You devise more experiments to test your hypotheses, utilizing a ﬂashlight to prove that
you are indeed not blind. In order to accept your last remaining hypothesis as the truth,
you could predict that changing the light bulb will ﬁx the problem. If all your predictions
succeed, the original hypothesis is valid and is accepted. In some cases, however, your
predictions will not occur, in which you'll have to start over. Perhaps the power is oﬀ.
Figure 1 How Science is Done
A diagram that illustrates scientiﬁc investigation
Scientists ﬁrst make observations that raise a particular question. In order to explain the
observed phenomenon, they develop a number of possible explanations, or hypotheses. This
is the inductive part of science, observing and constructing plausible arguments for why
7Biology - The Life Science
an event occurred. Experiments are then used to eliminate one of more of the possible
hypotheses until one hypothesis remains. Using deduction, scientists use the principles of
their hypothesis to make predictions, and then test to make sure that their predictions are
conﬁrmed. After many trials (repeatability) and all predictions have been conﬁrmed, the
hypothesis then may become a theory.
Quick Deﬁnitions
Observation - Quantitative and qualitative measurements of the world.
Inference - Deriving new knowledge based upon old knowledge.
Hypotheses - A suggested explanation.
Rejected Hypothesis - An explanation that has been ruled out through experimentation.
Accepted Hypothesis - An explanation that has not been ruled out through excessive
experimentation and makes veriﬁable predictions that are true.
Experiment - A test that is used to rule out a hypothesis or validate something already
known.
Scientiﬁc Method - The process of scientiﬁc investigation.
Theory - A widely accepted hypothesis that stands the test of time. Often tested, and
usually never rejected.
The scientiﬁc method is based primarily on the testing of hypotheses by experimentation.
This involves acontrol, or subject that does not undergo the process in question. A scientist
will also seek to limit variables to one or another very small number, single or minimum
number of variables. The procedure is to form a hypothesis or prediction about what you
believe or expect to see and then do everything you can to violate that, or falsify the
hypotheses. Although this may seem unintuitive, the process serves to establish more ﬁrmly
what is and what is not true.
A founding principle in science is a lack of absolute truth: the accepted explanation is the
most likely and is the basis for further hypotheses as well as for falsiﬁcation. All knowledge
has its relative uncertainty.
Theories are hypotheses which have withstood repeated attempts at falsiﬁcation. Common
theories include evolution by natural selection and the idea that all organisms consist of
cells. The scientiﬁc community asserts that much more evidence supports these two ideas
than contradicts them.
8Charles Darwin
2.4 Charles Darwin
Figure 2
Charles Darwin is most remembered today for his contribution of the theory of evolution
through natural selection.
The seeds of this theory were planted in Darwin's mind through observations made on a
ﬁve-year voyage through the New World on a ship called the Beagle. There, he studied
fossils and the geological record, geographic distribution of organisms, the uniqueness and
relatedness of island life forms, and the aﬃnity of island forms to mainland forms.
Upon his return to England, Darwin pondered over his observations and concluded that
evolution must occur through natural selection. He declined, however, to publish his work
because of its controversial nature. However, when another scientist, Wallace, reached similar
conclusions, Darwin was convinced to publish his observations in 1859. His hypothesis
revolutionized biology and has yet to be falsiﬁed by empirical data collected by mainstream
scientists.
2.5 After Darwin
Since Darwin's day, scientists have amassed a more complete fossil record, including
microorganisms and chemical fossils. These fossils have supported and added subtleties
to Darwin's theories. However, the age of the Earth is now held to be much older than
Darwin thought. Researchers have also uncovered some of the preliminary mysteries of
the mechanism of heredity as carried out through genetics and DNA, areas unknown to
Darwin. Another growing area is comparative anatomy including homology and analogy.
Today we can see a bit of evolutionary history in the development of embryos, as certain
(although not all) aspects of development recapitulate evolutionary history.
9Biology - The Life Science
15
The molecular biology study of slowly mutating genes reveal considerable evolutionary
history consistent with fossil and anatomical record.
2.6 Challenges to Darwin
Figure 3
Darwin and his theories have been challenged many times in the last 150 years. The
challenges have been primarily religious based on a perceived conﬂict with the preconceived
notion of creationism. Many of those who challenge Darwin have been adherents to the
young earth hypothesis that says that the Earth is only some 6000 years old and that all
species were individually created by a god. Some of the proponents of these theories have
suggested that chemical and physical laws that exist today were diﬀerent or nonexistent in
earlier ages. However, for the most part, these theories are either not scientiﬁcally testable
and fall outside the area of attention of the ﬁeld of biology, or have been disproved by one
or more ﬁelds of science.

17The Chemical Building Blocks of Life
4.6 Hereditary (Genetic) information
• Nucleic acids
• DNA: deoxyribonucleic acid
• Hereditary information of all cells
• Hereditary information for many viruses
• RNA: ribonucleic acid
5
• Hereditary information of certain viruses (HIV )
• Intermediate in gene expression
• Composed of nucleotides
• Ribonucleotides
• Deoxyribonucleotides
4.6.1 RNA DNA origin
• Which came ﬁrst?
• Paradox: DNA encodes protein necessary for its own replication
• Discovery of catalytic RNA by Cech and Altman suggested that RNA might have been
ﬁrst self-replicating molecule
• DNA evolved as more stable type of storage molecule

Cleveland State University.
Proteins: Their building block is amino acids. The bond connecting 2 of the amino acids
together are called peptide bonds. One of these bonds makes a monopeptide, two a dipeptide,
and any more than that makes a polypeptide.

185 Life: History and Origin
5.1 Properties of life
1. Organization: Being structurally composed of one or more cells, which are the basic
units of life.
• prokaryote: no nucleus
• eukaryote: membrane bound nucleus.
2. Sensitivity: respond to stimuli.
3. Energy Processing
4. Growth and Development
5. Reproduction
• hereditary mechanisms to make more of self; DNA based.
6. Regulation, including homeostasis.
7. Evolution.
5.2 Origin of life: 3 hypotheses
• Extraterrestrial origin (panspermia): meteor, comet borne from elsewhere in universe
• evidence of amino acids and other organic material in space (but often both D & L
forms)
• questionable bacterial fossils in Martian rock
-However, this would imply that some other origin of life was likely because it would have
had to happen elsewhere before it could be transported here, and the only diﬀerence would
be that life did not originate on Earth.
• Spontaneous origin on earth: primitive self-replicating macromolecules acted upon by
natural selection ((macro)Evolution is one example of this)
-This is often attacked for the seeming impossibility for life to have been produced by a
chemical reaction triggered by lightning and the ability of any produced DNA to actually be
in a sequence that could produce a working model of life if replicated. It is also attacked
for religious reasons, as it bypasses things like the idea of a supreme being directly creating
humans. It also seems unlikely to some that such huge changes are possible in evolution
19Life: History and Origin
without evidence of an "in-between stage" that is credible. Many of the stages of man are
disputed due to their somewhat shakey grounds. For example, bones from other animals
have been taken accidentally in some cases to be part of a humanoid, and complete skeletons
have been sketched out from a limited number of bones.
• Special creation: religious explanations (Intelligent Design is one popular example of
this.) These explanations contend that life was created by God (or perhaps some other
Intelligent Designer).
• Proponents of Intelligent design suggest that the vast complexity of life could only
have been intentionally designed while other creationists cite biblical support.
-This is often attacked for many of the same reasons that religion is attacked, and is often
regarded as superstitious and/or unscientiﬁc.
• It is debated as to whether schools should teach one hypothesis or the other when talking
about the origin of life. However, since they are all currently known major hypotheses
(and sometimes hypotheses proven wrong are shown for educational purposes), this
wikibook includes what it can without discriminating unfairly against one hypothesis or
the other.
5.3 The early earth
It is believed that the Earth was formed about 4.5 billion years ago.
• Heavy bombardment by rubble ceased about 3.8 billion years ago.
• Reducing atmosphere: much free H
• also H O, NH , CH
2 3 4
• little, if any, free O
2
• with numerous H electrons, require little energy to form organic compounds with C
• Warm oceans, estimated at 49-88°C
• Lack of O and consequent ozone (O ) meant considerable UV energy
2 3
Chemical reactions on early earth
• UV and other energy sources would promote chemical reactions and formation of organic
molecules
• Testable hypothesis: Miller-Urey experiment
• simulated early atmospheric conditions
• found amino acids, sugars, etc., building blocks of life
• won Nobel prize for work
• experiment showed prebiotic synthesis of biological molecules was possible
Issues
• Miller later conceded that the conditions in his experiments were not representative of
what is currently thought to be those of early earth
• He also conceded that science has no answer for how amino acids could self-organize into
replicating molecules and cells
• In the 50 years since Miller-Urey, signiﬁcant issues and problems for biogenesis have been
identiﬁed. This is a weak hypothesis at this time.
20Origin of cells
• Conclusion: Life exists, we don't know why.
5.4 Origin of cells
Cells are very small and decompose quickly after death. As such, fossils of the earliest cells
do not exist. Scientists have had to form a variety of theories on how cells (and hence life)
was created on Earth.
• Bubble hypothesis
• A. Oparin, J.B.S. Haldane, 1930’s
• Primary abiogenesis: life as consequence of geochemical processes
• Protobionts: isolated collections of organic material enclosed in hydrophobic bubbles
• Numerous variants: microspheres, protocells, protobionts, micelles, liposomes, coacer-
vates
• Other surfaces for evolution of life
• deep sea thermal vents
• ice crystals
• clay surfaces
• tidal pools
5.5 The RNA world?
• DNA→ RNA→ polypeptide (protein)
• Catalytic RNA: ribozyme
• discovered independently by Tom Cech and Sid Altman (Nobel prize)
• catalytic properties: hydrolysis, polymerization, peptide bond formation, etc.
• Self-replicating RNA molecule may have given rise to life
• consistent with numerous roles for RNA in cells as well as roles for ribonucleotides
(ATP)
• relationship to bubble-like structures is uncertain
5.6 The earliest cells
• Microfossils
• ˜3.5 by
• resemble bacteria: prokaryotes
• biochemical residues
• stromatolites
• Archaebacteria (more properly Archaea)
• extremophiles: salt, acid, alkali, heat, methanogens
• may not represent most ancient life
• Eubacteria
• cyanobacteria: photosynthesis
• atmospheric O ; limestone deposits
2
21Life: History and Origin
• chloroplasts of eukaryotes
Cyanobacteria
5.7 Major steps in evolution of life
• Prebiotic synthesis of macromolecules
• Self replication
• RNA? (primitive metabolism)
• DNA as hereditary material
• 1st cells
• Photosynthesis
• Aerobic respiration
• Multicellularity (more than once)

226 Cells
237 Cell structure
7.1 What is a cell?
The word cell comes from the Latin word "cella", meaning "small room", and it was ﬁrst
coined by a microscopist observing the structure of cork. The cell is the basic unit of all
living things, and all organisms are composed of one or more cells. Cells are so basic and
critical to the study of life, in fact, that they are often referred to as "the building blocks of
life". Organisms - bacteria, amoebae and yeasts, for example - may consist of as few as one
cell, while a typical human body contains about a trillion cells.
According to Cell Theory, ﬁrst proposed by Schleiden and Schwann in 1839, all life consists
of cells. The theory also states that all cells come from previously living cells, all vital
functions (chemical reactions) of organisms are carried out inside of cells, and that cells
contain necessary hereditary information to carry out necessary functions and replicate
themselves.
All cells contain:
1
• Lipid bilayer boundary (plasma membrane )
2
• Cytoplasm
3
• DNA (hereditary information)
4
• Ribosomes for protein synthesis
Eukaryotic cells also contain:
5
• At least one nucleus
6
• Mitochondria for cell respiration and energy
Cells may also contain:
7
• Lysosomes
8
• Peroxisomes
9
• Vacuoles
10
• Cell walls

25Cell structure
7.1.1 Concepts
Plasma Membrane
Phospholipid bilayer, which contains great amount of proteins, the most important functions
are the following:
1. It selectively isolates the content of the cell of the external atmosphere.
2. It regulates the interchange of substances between the cytoplasm and the environment.
3. Communicates with other cells.
Model of the ﬂuid mosaic
Describes the structure of the plasma membrane, this model was developed in 1972 by
cellular biologists J. Singer and L. Nicholson.
Phospholipid bilayer
Is in the plasma membrane and produces the ﬂuid part of membranes.
Proteins
Long chains of amino acids.
Glucose proteins
Proteins together with carbohydrates in the plasma membrane, mostly in the outer parts
of the cell.
Functions of proteins
Transport oxygen, they are components of hair and nails, and allow the cell interact with
its environment.
Transport Proteins
Regulate the movement of soluble water molecules, through the plasma membrane. Some
transport proteins called channel proteins form pores or channels in the membrane so
that water soluble molecules pass.
Carrying proteins
Have union sites that can hold speciﬁc molecules.
Reception proteins
They activate cellular responses when speciﬁc molecules join.
Proteins of recognition
They work as identiﬁers and as place of union to the cellular surface.
Fluid
It is any substance that can move or change of form.
Concentration
Number of molecules in a determined unit of volume.
26What is a cell?
Gradient
Physical diﬀerence between two regions of space, in such a way that the molecules tend to
move in response to the gradients.
Diﬀusion
Movement of the molecules in a ﬂuid, from the regions of high concentration to those of
low concentration.
Passive transport
Movement of substances in a membrane that doesn’t need to use energy.
Simple diﬀusion
Diﬀusion of water, gases or molecules across the membrane.
Facilitated diﬀusion
Diﬀusion of molecules across the membranes with the participation of proteins.
Osmosis
Diﬀusion of the water across a membrane with diﬀerential permeability.
Transport that needs energy
Movement of substances across a membrane generally in opposition to a gradient of
concentration with the requirement of energy.
Active transport
Movement of small molecules using energy (ATP).
Endocytosis
Movement of big particles towards the interior of the cell using energy. The cells enclose
particles or liquids.
Pinocytosis
(Literally cell drinking) Form in which the cell introduces liquids.
Phagocytosis
Way of eating of the cells. It feeds in this case of big particles or entire microorganisms.
Pseudopods
False feet (the amoeba).
Exocitosis
Movement of materials out of the cell with the use of energy. It throws waste material.
Isotonic
The cytoplasm ﬂuid of the interior of the cells is the same that the outer.
Hypertonic solution
27Cell structure
The solutions that have a higher concentration of dissolved particles than the cellular
cytoplasm and that therefore water of the cells goes out with osmosis.
Hypotonic
The solutions with a concentration of dissolved particles lower than the cytoplasm of a cell
and that therefore do that water enters the cell with osmosis.
Swelling
Pressure of the water inside the vacuole.
Endoplasmic Reticulum
It is the place of the synthesis of the cellular membrane.
7.1.2 Structure and function of the cell
Rudolf Virchow
Zoologist, who proposed the postulates of the cellular theory, observes that the living cells
could grow and be in two places at the same time, he proposed that all the cells come from
other equal cells and proposed 3 postulates:
1. Every living organism is formed from one or more cells
2. The smallest organisms are unicellular and these in turn are the functional units of
the multicellular organisms.
3. All the cells come from preexisting cells.
7.1.3 Common characteristics of all the cells
Molecular components
Proteins, amino acids, lipids, sweeten, DNA, RNA.
Structural components
Plasmatic membrane, citoplasm, ribosomes.
Robert Hooke
He postuled for the ﬁrst time the term cell
Prokaryotes
Their genetic material is not enclosed in a membrane ex. Bacterias
Eukaryotes
Their genetic material is contained inside a nucleus closed by a membrane
28History of cell knowledge
7.2 History of cell knowledge
The optical microscope was ﬁrst invented in 17th century. Shortly thereafter scientists began
to examine living and dead biological tissues in order to better understand the science of
life. Some of the most relevant discovery milestones of the time period include:
11
• The invention of the microscope , which allowed scientists for the ﬁrst time to see
biological cells
12
• Robert Hooke in 1665 looked at cork under a microscope and described what he called
cork "cells"
13
• Anton van Leeuwenhoek called the single-celled organisms that he saw under the
microscope "animalcules"
14
• Matthias Jakob Schleiden , a botanist, in 1838 determined that all plants consist of
cells
15
• Theodor Schwann , a zoologist, in 1839 determined that all animals consist of cells
16
• Rudolf Virchow proposed the theory that all cells arise from previously existing cells
In 1838, the botanist Matthias Jakob Schleiden and the physiologist Theodor Schwann
discovered that both plant cells and animal cells had nuclei. Based on their observations,
the two scientists conceived of the hypothesis that all living things were composed of cells.
In 1839, Schwann published 'Microscopic Investigations on the Accordance in the Structure
and Growth of Plants and Animals', which contained the ﬁrst statement of their joint cell
theory.
7.2.1 Cell Theory
Schleiden and Schwann proposed spontaneous generation as the method for cell origination,
17
but spontaneous generation (also called abiogenesis ) was later disproven. Rudolf Virchow
famously stated "Omnis cellula e cellula"... "All cells only arise from pre-existing cells." The
parts of the theory that did not have to do with the origin of cells, however, held up to
scientiﬁc scrutiny and are widely agreed upon by the scientiﬁc community today.
The generally accepted portions of the modern Cell Theory are as follows: (1) The cell is the
fundamental unit of structure and function in living things. (2) All organisms are made up
of one or more cells. (3) Cells arise from other cells through cellular division. (4) Cells carry
genetic material passed to daughter cells during cellular division. (5) All cells are essentially
the same in chemical composition. (6) Energy ﬂow (metabolism and biochemistry) occurs
within cells.

7.3 Microscopes
• Allow greater resolution, can see ﬁner detail
• Eye: resolution of ˜ 100 μm
18
• Light microscope : resolution of ˜ 200 nm
• Limited to cells are larger organelles within cells
19
• Confocal microscopy : 2 dimension view
20
• Electron microscope : resolution of ˜0.2 nm
• Laser tweezers: move cell contents
7.4 Cell size
One may wonder why all cells are so small. If being able to store nutrients is beneﬁcial
to the cell, how come there are no animals existing in nature with huge cells? Physical
limitations prevent this from occurring. A cell must be able to diﬀuse gases and nutrients in
and out of the cell. A cell's surface area does not increase as quickly as its volume, and as a
result a large cell may require more input of a substance or output of a substance than it
is reasonably able to perform. Worse, the distance between two points within the cell can
be large enough that regions of the cell would have trouble communicating, and it takes a
relatively long time for substances to travel across the cell.
That is not to say large cells don't exist. They are, once again, less eﬃcient at exchanging
materials within themselves and with their environment, but they are still functional. These
cells typically have more than one copy of their genetic information, so they can manufacture
proteins locally within diﬀerent parts of the cell.
Key concepts: Cell size:
• Is limited by need for regions of cell to communicate
• Diﬀuse oxygen and other gases
21 22
• Transport of mRNA and protein s
• Surface area to volume ratio limited
• Larger cells typically:
• Have extra copies of genetic information
• Have slower communication between parts of cell

Eukaryotic cells feature membrane delimited nucleii containing two or more linear chromo-
2 3 4
some s; numerous membrane-bound cytoplasmic organelles: mitochondria, RER , SER ,
5 6 7
lysosomes, vacuole s, chloroplast s; ribosomes and a cytoskeleton . Also, plants, fungi, and
some protists have a cell wall.
8.1 Structure of the nucleus
The nucleus is the round object in the cell that holds the genetic information (DNA) of the
cell. It is surrounded by a nuclear envelope and has a nucleolus inside.
8.1.1 Nuclear envelope
8
The nuclear envelope is a double-layered plasma membrane like the cell membrane, although
without membrane proteins. To allow some chemicals to enter the nucleus, the nuclear
9
envelope has structures called Nuclear pore s. The nuclear envelope is continuous with the
endoplasmic reticulum.
8.1.2 Nucleolus
The nucleolus appears in a microscope as a small dark area within the nucleus. The nucleolus
10
is the area where there is a high amount of DNA transcription taking place.

Chromosomes consist of chromatin . This is made up of strings of DNA, which typically
12
measure centimeters in length if stretched out. This DNA is wound around a histone core
13
and organized into nucleosome s.
14 15 16
The chromatin must be uncoiled for gene expression and replication . Chromosome
micrograph
8.3 Endoplasmic reticulum
17 18
The endoplasmic reticulum is a cellular organelle made up of a series of extended folded
intracellular membranes. It is continuous with the nuclear membane.
There are two main types of endoplasmic reticulum:
19
• RER: rough endoplasmic reticulum (site of protein synthesis ) associated with ribosomes
20
• SER: smooth endoplasmic reticulum (site of lipid synthesis )
8.3.1 Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum
21
Proteins are directed to the RER by a signal sequence of a growing polypeptide s on
the ribosome. This is recognised by a signal recognition particle which brings the ribo-
some/polypeptide complex to a channel on the RER called a translocon. At the translocon,
the signal sequence and ribosome/polypeptide complex interact with the translocon to open
it. The signal sequence becomes attached to the translocon. The ribosome can continue to
translate the polypeptide into the lumen of the RER. As synthesis continues, 2 processes
can happen.
1. If the protein is destined to become a membrane bound protein then the protein
synthesis will continue until termination. The ribosome can then dissociate, allowing
protein folding within the RER lumen to occur and continuation to the golgi apparatus
for processing of the polypeptide.
2. Iftheproteinisdestinedforstorageforlatersecretionafterstimulationorforcontinuous
secretion then a protease-enzyme which cuts proteins at the peptide bond-can cut the
signal sequence from the growing polypeptide. Continuation to the golgi etc. can then
occur.

32Endoplasmic reticulum
When produced, proteins are then exported to one of several locations. The proteins are
either modiﬁed for extracellular membrane insertion or secretion. Note, this is in contrast
with ribosomes which do not associate with the RER and produce proteins which will become
cytosolic enzymes for example.
8.3.2 Smooth Endoplasmic Reticulum
22
Smooth endoplasmic reticulum produces enzyme s for lipid and carbohydrate biosynthesis
and detoxiﬁcation RER
8.3.3 Sarcoplasmic Reticulum
This is a specialised form of endoplasmic reticulum found in some muscle cell types-
particularly striated, skeletal muscle. Its main function is diﬀerent from the other 2 types in
that is mainly acts as a storage of calcium. This reticulum has voltage gated channels which
respond to signals from 'motor neurones' to open and release calcium into the cytoplasm.
This can then bring about the next part in muscle contraction.

8.4 The Golgi apparatus
24
The golgi apparatus is made up of multiple stacks of bilipid membranes.
• Proteins made on the RER are modiﬁed and then sorted
• Formation of secretory vesicles
• Formation of lysosomes (intracellular digestion)
Other membrane-bound cytoplasmic organelles include:
25
• Microbodies (generic term)
• Glyoxysome (transforms fat into carbohydrate in plants)
26
• Peroxisome (uses oxidative metabolism to form hydrogen peroxide and is destroyed by
27
catalase )
8.5 Ribosomes
Ribosomes are the site of protein synthesis. Ribosomes themselves are synthesized in the
28
cell nucleoli and are structured as two subunits, the large and the small. These parts are
composed of RNA and protein.
Prokaryotic and eukaryotic ribosomes are diﬀerent, the eukaryotic ones being larger and
more complicated.
8.6 DNA-containing organelles
Mitochondria

• Microtubule organizing centers
• Animal cells and many protists
• Pair constitutes the centrosome
• Give rise to ﬂagellum during spermatogenesis
• Consist of 9 triplet microtubules
31 32
• Mitosis , meiosis
8.7 Cytoskeleton
Cytoskeleton is a collective term for diﬀerent ﬁlaments of proteins that can give physical
shape within the cell and are responsible for the 'roads' which organelles can be carried
along.
• Gives the cell shape
• Anchors other organelles
• Vital to intracellular transport of large molecules
The cytoskeleton is composed of 3 main types of ﬁlaments:
33
• Actin ﬁlaments (7 nm)
34
• Microtubule s: (25 nm) polymer of tubulin; 13/ring.
35
• Intermediate Filament s
Both actin and microtubules can have associated motor proteins.
8.7.1 Intermediate Filaments
These are rope like ﬁlaments, 8-10nm in diameter and tend to give the structural stability to
cells. Examples inculude Vimentin, neuroﬁlaments and keratin. It is keratin which priniciply
makes up hair, nails and horns.
8.7.2 Actin Filaments
Growth
These ﬁlaments are 2-stranded and composed of dimeric subunits called G-Actin. They
contain a GTP molecule in order to bind (polymerise). As GTP is hydrolysed then the
structure becomes unstable and depolymerisation occurs. The growth of actin ﬁlaments is
concentration dependant-that is, the higher the concentration of free G-actin, the greater
the polymerisation. The are also polar, having a + and a - end (not related to charge) and
polymerisation tends to happen faster at the + end.

Cilia and ﬂagella are threads of microtubules that extend from the exterior of cells and used
to move single celled organisms as well as move substances away from the surface of the cell.

37Membranes
Biological membranes surround cells and serve to keep the insides separated from the outsides.

They are formed of phospholipid bilayer s, which by deﬁnition are a double layer of fatty
2 3
acid molecules (mostly phospholipid s, lipids containing lots of phosphorus).

Proteins serveveryimportantfunctionsincellularmembranes. Theyareactivetransports
in and out of the cell, acting as gatekeepers. They relay signals in and out of the cell.

• Chemical reactions break and make bonds, producing changes in energy
• Under constant conditions of temperature, pressure and volume,ΔG =ΔH - TΔS
• ΔG, change in free energy
• If positive (+), H is higher, S is lower, so there is more free energy; endergonic reaction,
does not proceed spontaneously; require input of energy (e.g., heat)

4913 Photosynthesis
6 CO + 6 H O→ C H O + 6 O
2 2 6 12 6 2
• One of most important reactions in history of life:
• source of atmospheric O
2
• ultimately led to aerobic respiration and eukaryotes
• Responsible for bulk of glucose production
• Early experiments showed that mass of plant must be derived from substances in the air,
not the soil
• Experiments with isotopes showed that liberated oxygen comes from water
• Experiments also showed that light is essential but that some reactions (e.g., reduction of
CO ) continue in the dark
2
• Plants do two big, important things during photosynthesis: gain energy (absorb light)
and build sugar (glucose).
• Photosynthesis can be divided into two series of chemical reactions: the light (light-
dependent) reactions and the dark (light-independent) reactions. In light reactions, light
is absorbed; in dark reactions, sugar is built.
• Occurs when plants, algae, and autotrophic bacteria absorb light energy and build glucose.
13.1 Light Reactions
• Part of the electromagnetic spectrum
• Consists of units of energy called photons
• Photons at UV end of spectrum have more energy than those at the red end
• Occur on the surface of thylakoid disks
• Chlorophyll and other plant pigments diﬀerentially absorb photons
• Chlorophyll a: light to chemical energy
• Chlorophyll b: accessory chlorophyll
• Chlorophylls absorb primarily blue and red (green reﬂected back, hence the green
color of plants)
13.1.1 Accessory pigments
• Chlorophyll is a major light gathering pigment
• Absorbs light with considerable eﬃciency (i.e., retaining energy)
• Accessory pigments
• Chlorophyll b
• Carotenoinds
• capture light of wavelengths not captured by chlorophylls
51Photosynthesis
• Confer other colors to plant leaves (autumn colors too)
Photosynthetic steps
• Primary photoevent: light photon captured by photosystem and energy transferred to
electron donated by water
• Electron transport: excited electron is shuttled along imbedded series of electron carriers
to proton pump and electron is transferred to acceptor
• Chemiosmosis: transport of protons back into chloroplast drives synthesis of ATP
13.1.2 The Even More Detailed Light Reactions
What the Light Reactions Do:
The light reactions of photosynthesis occur in chloroplasts in and on the thylakoid disks.
During the light reactions, light energy charges up ATP molecules. More speciﬁcally, light
turns the chloroplast into an acid battery, and this battery charges up ATP.
How the "Chloroplast-Battery" Charges ATP:
The stroma is the ﬂuid inside of the chloroplasts, and it carries a negative charge. This
means that it contains about a "gazillion" extra electrons. The solvent of stroma is water.
The ﬂuid inside the thylakoid disks is positively charged because it contains a lot of hydrogen
(H+) ions. The pH here is low, making the ﬂuid very acidic. The solvent of thylakoid disk
ﬂuid is water.
A chloroplast acts like a battery, because it has separated a strong positive charge and a
strong negative charge in two diﬀerent compartments. Energy is released when H+ ions
(free protons) ﬂow from the inside of a thylakoid disk to the stroma. This is electrical energy,
since it is a ﬂow of charged particles.
The protons pass through special channels (made of protein) in the thylakoid membrane;
this reaction is 'exothermic.' The energy that is given oﬀ is used to fuel this reaction (Pi is
the phosphate ion):
ADP + Pi --> ATP
The proton can go to the negative stroma, but only if it uses its energy to charge up ATP.
Since one reaction wants to go, and the other one doesn't, and since the ﬁrst reaction releases
energy and the second one absorbs energy, the two reactions are known to be 'coupled'
together so that the ﬁrst fuels the second. Of course, a special enzyme must be involved for
this to happen.
Chlorophyll Molecules on a Thylakoid Disk:
Hundreds of chlorophyll molecules cover the surface of a thylakoid disk, making the disk
green. The nonpolar "tails" of the chlorophyll molecule are embedded in the membrane of
the thylakoid.
52“Dark” reactions
13.2 “Dark” reactions
• ATP drives endergonic reactions
• NADPH provides hydrogens for reduction of CO to carbohydrate (C-H bonds)
2
• Occur in the stroma
• First step in carbon ﬁxation
13.2.1 The Detailed Dark Reactions
What the Dark Reactions Do:
The dark reactions build sugar from carbon dioxide gas (CO2), water (H2O), and energy
from ATP molecules that were charged up during the light reactions. The dark reactions
occur in the stroma of a chloroplast. Dark reactions usually occur in the light, but they
don't have to. They'll occur in the dark until the chloroplast's supply of ATP runs out
(usually about 30 seconds).
The Calvin Cycle:
The Calvin Cycle is the fancy name for the metabolic pathway that builds sugar. This
means that it involves a whole lot of chemical reactions, and it uses a lot of diﬀerent enzymes
to catalyze the reactions.
Carbon dioxide gas is stable, therefore the bonds that hold the carbon and oxygen atoms
are strong. Therefore it takes a lot of energy to break the bonds and separate the carbon
atoms from the oxygen atoms. The energy needed to do this comes from ATP molecules.
When inorganic carbon (like from CO2) is being added to an organic molecule (such as
sugar), this is called carbon ﬁxation.
It takes 2 complete turns of the Calvin Cycle to make a glucose molecule.

6115 Genetics
6316 Gregor Mendel and biological
inheritance
1
Charles Darwin , for all he contributed to the science of biology, never knew about the
mechanism by which living things inherit traits from previous generations, or how new traits
arise.
As any schoolchild can tell you, this mechanism of interitance has since been found to be
2
DNA , or deoxyribonucleic acid. DNA allows for stable inheritance of traits: the code in
each strand of DNA is replicated precisely through the pairing of basic units along each
strand. The error rate in this replication is amazingly low; not even one base pair in a
million matches out of sequence.
However, when even one base pair is added to a new strain of DNA in an order diﬀerently
than in the parent chain, it can be the basis of amutation. These changes in DNA sequences
are the microscopic origin of changes in traits of all studied living things. Even the smallest
diﬀerence in a strand of DNA can result in a change in traits that can cost the life of the
organism. Mutations can produce proteins with a new or altered function. In humans, the
3
example of Sickle cell anemia is commonly given as its origin is a diﬀerence of only one
base pair in a section of DNA that encodes red blood cells.
Individual sequences of DNA that encode for speciﬁc proteins are called genes and are the
4
units of heredity. Each one has a set nucleotide , and together all of the genes (and some
sequence of DNA that apparently do not code for any biologically important functions)
5
together make up the entire chromosome
16.1 Mendel
• Discovered principle of genetic segregation via numerous experiments utilizing pea plants
• Inferred the existence of genes through segregation of phenotypes
• Used quantitative methods: counted; ratios
• Work is model of scientiﬁc method
• In particular, observed the F2 progeny, which lead to the discovery of dominant and
recessive traits
• Published work in 1866, went unnoticed
• In 1900 his scientiﬁc paper was “rediscovered”

5 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chromosome
65Gregor Mendel and biological inheritance
• Mendel is acknowledged as founder of Genetics
• still used alphabet letters to designate genes
• still refer to dominant and recessive genes
• still refer to segregation of alleles in meiosis
• principle of segregation applies to all sexually reproducing organisms; Mendel’s results
were immediately applied to humans in 1900
16.2 Mendel’s experiments
• 1856, began experiments with the garden pea, Pisum sativum
• 1865, presented results to the Bruno natural history society, which he helped found
• 1866, published his results in proceedings of the society
• Naegeli encouraged Mendel to reproduce results in another species, which failed because
the species did not undergo true fertilization
• discrete traits in Pisum sativum
• pure-breeding lines
• dominant/recessive alleles
• alleles are two alternate versions of a gene
• gametes contain hybridized chromosomes that are formed during meiosis
• homozygous has two of the same allele
• heterozygous has two diﬀerent alleles
• reciprocal F1 crosses (all exhibiting dominant phenotypes); F2; F3
• counted oﬀspring, noted ratios
• inferred genotypes from phenotypes
• tested hypotheses with testcrosses
• attempted to repeat with another species
16.3 Mendel’s seven pairs of traits
1. Seed form (round or wrinkled)
2. Cotyledon color (green or yellow)
3. Seed coat color (white or colored)
4. Pod form (inﬂated or constricted)
5. Pod color (green or yellow)
6. Flower position (axial or terminal)
7. Plant heights (tall or short)
16.4 Locus
• The location of a speciﬁc gene within a chromosome
66Modern Y chromosome
16.5 Modern Y chromosome
Y-chromosome is the most evolved chromosome. Generally it is thought that if Y- chro-
mosome is present in an individual then he will be male. But if mutation occurs at sex
determining region or zinc factor then it will not code for testis determining factor, and
results in normal female. This type of female's frequency is 1/250000.
16.6 Chromosome phenomena
• X-chromosome inactivation
• Barr bodies
• Nondisjunction: failure of chromosome segregation at meiosis or mitosis
• Results in 2N± 1 chromosome number
• Trisomy 2N + 1
• Usually lethal. Trisomy 21 (Down) exception
• Monosomy 2N ** 1
• Lethal except XO
• Usually maternal origin in humans
16.7 X-chromosome inactivation
In females, one X-chromosone is randomly switched oﬀ forming a Barr body.
16.8 Barr body
Dense region in the nucleus formed by the inactive X-chromosome.
16.9 Human genetic disorders
Down's Syndrome(Mongolism)
Down's Syndrome is usually produced by the nondisjunction of chromosome 21 during
oogenesis and sometimes during spermatogenesis. The individual suﬀering from this type of
syndrome has 47 chromosomes instead of the normal 46. The extra chromosome is not a sex
chromosome but an autosome.
Most cases of mongolism were found to occur in children born by women in their forties.
The aﬀected children, called mongoloids, show mental retardation and have a shorter life
expectancy. Their most prominent feature is the Mongolian folds in their eyes; hence, the
term mongolism.
Klinefelter's Syndrome
67Gregor Mendel and biological inheritance
When an XY-bearing sperm unites with an X-bearing egg, the resulting condition is called
Klinefelter's Syndrome, or sexually undeveloped male. Individuals having the syndrome
show the following characteristics:
• testes are small
• sperms are never produced
• breasts are enlarged
• body hair is sparse
• individuals are mentally defective
The same abnormal meiotic division may occur in females. They produce eggs with XX or
no sex chromosomes. Such egg, when fertilized by a Y-bearing sperm, will not develop (YO).
This is because YO is lethal--it wil cause death to the oﬀspring.
6817 DNA: The Genetic Material
17.1 DNA
DNA stands for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid. That is, a nucleic acid with two sugars. DNA is
the hereditary material of cells and is considered the blueprint of life. DNA is found in all
kingdoms of life. Even most viruses have DNA. A molecule of DNA is chemically stable (it
does not have a 2-prime alcohol group.)
When someone says DNA, they may be referring to one's genetic material on multiple levels:
They may be speaking about a single deoxyribose nucleic acid molecule, a section of a double
helix, a section of a chromosome, or one's entire hereditary composition.
• antiparallel
• Double helix
• Semiconservative replication
• Sequence of nucleotides encodes functional RNA or polypeptide
17.2 Historical perspective
• Mitosis and meiosis
• Regular distribution of chromosomes suggested that they contain hereditary informa-
tion
• Bridges/Morgan, usingDrosophilamelanogastershowedthatgenesareonchromosomes
(1910s)
• Hammerling: nucleus contains hereditary information (1930s)
• Griﬃth: transformation of bacteria (1928)
• Avery, MacLeod, McCarty: transforming substance is DNA (1944)
• Hershey, Chase: DNA is hereditary material of viruses (1952)
• Rosalind Franklin
• Watson and Crick: structure of DNA (1953)
17.3 Hershey-Chase Experiment
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading suggestions that DNA was a
genetic material. Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA
into a bacterium. They did two experiments marking either the DNA in the phage with
a radioactive phophorus or the protein of the phage with radioactive sulfur. With the
bacteria that was infected by the phages with radioactive DNA the DNA in the bacteria
69DNA: The Genetic Material
was radioactive. In the bacteria that was infected with the radioactive protein the bacteria
was radioactive, not the DNA. This proves that DNA is a genetic material and it is passed
on in viruses.
17.4 DNA/RNA components
• Miescher: discovered DNA, 1869
17.4.1 Structure of DNA
DNA is in a double helix structure made up of nucleotides. The "backbone" of the double
helix is composed of phosphates connected to a ﬁve carbon sugar called deoxyribose, . The
"rungs" are composed of nitrogenous bases, Purines and Pyrimidines. Purines contain
Adenine(A) and Guanine(G) and have two rings in their structures. Pyrimidines contain
Cytosine(C) and Thymine (T) and have one ring in their structures.

8020 Mutation
1
A mutation is a permanent change to an organism's genetic material (DNA or RNA).
Mutations are a rare but signiﬁcant biological process, since they provide the variation on
2
which evolution acts and are also the source of cancer.
3
An organism's genetic material is made up of polymers (chains) of four diﬀerent nucleotides ,
like a recipe book written in a language of only four letters. A mutation event is when the
order of the nucleotides in DNA change, usually when the DNA is being copied.
Mutations come in a number of forms:
20.1 Point Mutations
Point mutations are all mutations which involve a single nucleotide. These come in the form
of substitutions, insertions and deletions:
20.2 Substitution
Substitution Mutations: In substitution mutations, a nitrogenous base of a triplet codon of
DNA is replaced by another nitrogen base or some derivative of the nitrogen base, changing
the codon. The altered codon codes for a diﬀerent amino acid substitution.The substitution
mutations are of two types:
1.Transitions: It is the replacement of one purine in a polynucleotide chain by another
purine(A by G or C by A) or one pyrimidine by another pyrimidine(T by C or C by T)
2.Transversions:A base pair substitution involving the substitution of a purine by pyrimidine
or pyrimidine by a purine is called transversion.

20.4.2 Fusion
20.4.3 Fission
20.4.4 Segmental Duplication
20.4.5 Chromosomal Duplication
20.4.6 Genome Duplication
20.5 Causes of mutations
20.6 Eﬀects of mutations
Mutations can have a variety of diﬀerent eﬀects depending on the type of mutation, the
signiﬁcance of the piece of genetic material aﬀected and whether the cells aﬀected are germ-
82Further reading
line cells. Only mutations in germ-line cells can be passed on to children, while mutations
elsewhere can cause cell-death or cancer.
Mutations can be classiﬁed by their eﬀects:
20.6.1 Silent Mutation
Silent Mutations are DNA mutations that do not result in a change to the amino acid
sequence or a protein. They may occur in a non-coding region (outside of a gene or within
an intron), or they may occur within an exon in a manner that does not alter the ﬁnal
amino acid chain.
20.6.2 Frameshift
20.6.3 Missense Mutation
Missense mutations are types of point mutations where a single nucleotide is changed to
cause substitution of a diﬀerent amino acid. This in turn can render the resulting protein
nonfunctional. Such mutations are responsible for diseases such as Epidermolysis bullosa.

9122 Classiﬁcation of Living Things
22.0.1 Classiﬁcation of Living Things & Naming
With so many ﬂora and fauna on planet Earth, there must be a method to classify each
organism to distinguish it from others so it can be correctly identiﬁed. Classiﬁcation does
not only apply to biology. For example, supermarkets and grocery stores organise their
products by classifying them. Beverages may occupy one aisle, while cleaning supplies may
occupy another. In science, the practice of classifying organisms is called taxonomy (Taxis
means arrangement and nomos means law). The modern taxonomic system was developed
by the Swedish botanist Carolus (Carl) Linneaeus (1707-1788). He used simple physical
characteristics of organisms to identify and diﬀerentiate between diﬀerent species.
Linneaeus developed a hierarchy of groups for taxonomy. To distinguish diﬀerent levels of
similarity, each classifying group, called taxon (pl. taxa) is subdivided into other groups.
To remember the order, it is helpful to use a mnemonic device. The taxa in hierarchical
order:
• Domain - Archea, Eubacteria, Eukaryote
• Kingdom - Plants, Animals, Fungi, Protists, Eubacteria (Monera), Archaebacteria
• Phylum
• Class
• Order
• Family
• Genus
• Species
The domain is the broadest category, while species is the most speciﬁc category available.
The taxon Domain was only introduced in 1990 by Carl Woese, as scientists reorganise
things based on new discoveries and information. For example, the European Hare would
be classiﬁed as follows:
Eukaryote --> Animal --> Chordata --> Mammalia --> Lagomorpha --> Leporidae -->
Lepus --> Lepus europaeus.
Binomial nomenclature is used to name an organism, where the ﬁrst word beginning
with a capital is the genus of the organism and the second word beginning with lower-case
letter is the species of the organism. The name must be in italics and in Latin, which was
the major language of arts and sciences in the 18th century. The scientiﬁc name can be also
abbreviated, where the genus is shortened to only its ﬁrst letter followed by a period. In our
example, Lepus europaeus would become L. europaeus'.
Taxonomy and binomial nomenclature are both speciﬁc methods of classifying an organism.
They help to eliminate problems, such as mistaken identity and false assumptions, caused
by common names. An example of the former is the fact that a North American robin is
93Classiﬁcation of Living Things
quite diﬀerent from the English robin. An example of the latter is the comparison between
crayﬁsh and catﬁsh, where one might believe that they both are ﬁsh when in fact, they are
quite diﬀerent.
Nomenclature is concerned with the assignment of names to taxonomic groups in agreement
with published rules.
22.0.2 Eukaryotes & Prokaryotes
Recall that there are two basic types of cells: eukaryotes and prokaryotes.
Eukaryotes are more complex in structure, with nuclei and membrane-bound organelles.
Some characteristics of eukaryotes are:
• Large (100 - 1000 μm)
• DNA in nucleus, bounded by membrane
• Genome consists of several chromosomes.
• Sexual reproduction common, by mitosis and meiosis
• Mitochondria and other organelles present
• Most forms are multicellular
• Aerobic
Prokaryotes refer to the smallest and simplest type of cells, without a true nucleus and no
membrane-bound organelles. Bacteria fall under this category. Some characteristics:
• Small (1-10 μm)
• DNA circular, unbounded
• Genome consists of single chromosome.
• Asexual reproduction common, not by mitosis or meiosis.
• No general organelles
• Most forms are singular
• Anaerobic
22.0.3 The Three Domains
The three domains are organised based on the diﬀerence between eukaryotes and prokaryotes.
Today's living prokaryotes are extremely diverse and diﬀerent from eukaryotes. This fact has
been proven by molecular biological studies (e.g. of RNA structure) with modern technology.
The three domains are as follows:
Archea (Archeabacteria) consists of archeabacteria, bacteria which live in extreme
environments. The kingdom Archaea belongs to this domain.
Eubacteriaconsistsofmoretypicalbacteriafoundineverydaylife. ThekingdomEubacteria
belongs to this domain.
Eukaryote encompasses most of the world's visible living things. The kingdoms Protista,
Fungi, Plantae, and Animalia fall under this category.
94Stem cells
22.0.4 The Six Kingdoms
Under the three domains are six kingdoms in taxonomy. The ﬁrst two, Plants andAnimals,
are commonly understood and will not be expounded here.
Protista, the third kingdom, was introduced by the German biologist Ernst Haeckel in
1866 to classify micro-organisms which are neither animals nor plants. Since protists are
quite irregular, this kingdom is the least understood and the genetic similarities between
organisms in this kingdom are largely unknown. For example, some protists can exhibit
properties of both animals and plants.
Fungi are organisms which obtain food by absorbing materials in their bodies. Mushrooms
and moulds belong in this kingdom. Originally, they were part of the plant kingdom but
were recategorised when they were discovered not to photosynthesise.
Eubacteria are bacteria, made up of small cells, which diﬀer in appearance from the
organisms in the above kingdoms. They lack a nucleus and cell organelles. They have cell
walls made of peptidoglycan.
Archae (or Archaebacteria) are bacteria which live in extreme environments, such as
salt lakes or hot, acidic springs. These bacteria are in their own category as detailed studies
have shown that they have unique properties and features (ex. unusual lipids that are not
found in any other organism)which diﬀer them from other bacteria and which allow them to
live where they live. Their cell walls lack peptidoglycan.
22.0.5 Origins of Diversity
The diversity in our planet is attributed to diversity within a species. As the world changed
in climate and in geography as time passed, the characteristics of species diverged so much
that new species were formed. This process, by which new species evolve, was ﬁrst described
by British naturalist Charles Darwin as natural selection.
For an organism to change, genetic mutations must occur. At times, genetic mutations are
accidental, as in the case of prokaryotes when they undergo asexual reproduction. For most
eukaryotes, genetic mutations occur through sexual reproduction, where meiosis produces
haploid gametes from the original parent cells. The fusion of these haploid gametes into
a diploid zygote results in genetic variation in each generation. Over time, with enough
arrangement of genes and traits, new species are produced. Sexual reproduction creates an
immense potential of genetic variety.
One goal of taxonomy is to determine the evolutionary history of organisms. This can be
achieved by comparing species living today with species in the past. The comparison in
anatomy and structure is based on data from development, physical anatomy, biochemistry,
DNA, behaviour, and ecological preferences. The following are examples of how such data is
used:
• Anatomy:
Although a horse and a human may look diﬀerent, there is evidence that their arm structures
are quite similar. Their arms' sizes and proportions may be diﬀerent, but the anatomical
structures are quite similar. Such evidence reveals that animals in diﬀerent taxa may not
95Classiﬁcation of Living Things
be that diﬀerent. Biological features from a common evolutionary origin are known as
homologous.
• Development
• Biochemistry:
Biochemical analysis of animals similar in appearance have yielded surprising results. For
example, although guinea pigs were once considered to be rodents, like mice, biochemistry
led them to be in their taxon of their own.
22.0.6 Phylogeny, Cladistics & Cladogram
Modern taxonomy is based on many hypotheses' of the evolutionary history of organisms,
known as phylogeny. As with the Scientiﬁc Method, scientists develop a hypothesis on the
history of an animal and utilise modern science and technology to prove the phylogeny.
Cladistics is a classiﬁcation system which is based on phylogeny. Expanding on phylogeny,
cladistics is based on the assumption that each group of related species has one common
ancestor and would therefore retain some ancestral characteristics. Moreover, as these
related species evolve and diverge from their common ancestor, they would develop unique
characteristics. Such characteristics are known as derived characteristics
The principles of phylogeny and cladistics can be expressed visually as a cladogram,
a branching diagram which acts as a family (phylogenetic) tree for similar species. A
cladogram can also be used to test alternative hypotheses for an animal's phylogeny. In
order to determine the most likely cladogram, the derived characteristics of similar species
are matched and analysed.

22.1 Introduction
Viruses are the smallest biological particle (the tiniest are only 20 nm in diameter). However,
they are not biological organisms so they are not classiﬁed in any kingdom of living things.
They do not have any organelles and cannot respire or perform metabolic functions. Viruses
are merely strands of DNA or RNA surrounded by a protective protein coat called a capsid.
Viruses only come to life when they have invaded a cell. Outside of a host cell, viruses are
completely inert.
Since ﬁrst being identiﬁed in 1935, viruses have been classiﬁed into more than 160 major
groups. Viruses are classiﬁed based on their shape, replication properties, and the diseases
that they cause. Furthermore, the shape of a virus is determined by the type and arrangement
of proteins in its capsid. Viruses pathogenic to humans are currently classiﬁed into 21 groups.
Viruses can also attack bacteria and infect bacterial cells. Such viruses are called bacterio-
phages.
97Classiﬁcation of Living Things
22.2 Viral Replication
As previously stated, viruses are not a biological life form so they cannot reproduce by
themselves. They need to take over a functioning eukaryotic or prokaryotic cell to replicate
its DNA or RNA and to make protein coat for new virus particles.
In order to enter a cell, a virus must attach to a speciﬁc receptor site on the plasma membrane
of the host cell. The proteins on the surface of the virus act as keys which ﬁt exactly into a
matching glycoprotein on the host cell membrane. In some viruses, the attachment protein
is not on the surface of the virus but is in the capsid or in the envelope.
There are two forms of viral replication: the lytic cycle and the lysogenic cycle.
22.2.1 Lytic Cycle
1. Attachment: The virus binds to speciﬁc receptors on the host cell.
2. Entry: There are two ways in which a virus can enter cells. Firstly, the virus can inject
its nucleic acid into the host cell. Secondly, if a virus is contained in an envelope, the
host cell can phagocytosise the entire virus particle into a vacuole. When the virus
breaks out of the vacuole, it then releases its nucleic acid into the cell.
3. Replication: The virus's nucleic acid instructs the host cell to replicate the virus's
DNA or RNA.
4. Assembly: New virus particles are assembled.
5. Lysis and Release: The virus directs the production of an enzyme which damages
the host cell wall, causing the host cell to swell and burst. The newly formed virus
particles are now released.
22.2.2 Lysogenic Cycle
1. Attachment: Similar to Lytic Cycle
2. Entry: Similar to Lytic Cycle
3. Incorporation: The viral nucleic acids is not replicated, but instead integrated by
genetic combination (crossing over) into the host cell's chromosome. When integrated
in a host cell this way, the viral nucleic acid as part of the host cell's chromosome is
known as a prophage.
4. Host Cell Reproduction: The host cell reproduces normally. Subsequent cell divisions,
daughter cells, contain original father cell's chromosome embedded with a prophage.
5. Cycle Induction: Certain factors now determine whether the daughter cell undergoes
the lytic or lysogenic cycle. At any time, a cell undergoing the lysogenic cycle can
switch to the lytic cycle.
The reproduction cycle of viruses with RNA and no DNA is slightly diﬀerent. A notable
example of a RNA-based virus is HIV, a retrovirus.
98Viral Genome
Retrovirus reproductive cycle
1. The retrovirus force RNA into cell, by either one of the two methods of entry (See
above).
2. In the retrovirus are reverse transcriptase enzymes, which catalyses the synthesis of a
DNA strand complementary to the viral RNA.
3. Reverse transcriptase catalyses a second DNA strand complementary to the ﬁrst. With
these two strands, the double-stranded DNA can be created.
4. DNA is then incorporated into the host cell's chromosomes. Similar to the concept of
a prophage, this incorporated DNA is called a provirus. However, the provirus never
leaves the host cell, unlike a prophage.
5. The infected host cell undergoes the lytic or lysogenic cycle.
22.3 Viral Genome
The genome of a virus consists of DNA or RNA, whose size and conﬁguration vary. The
entire genome can exist as a single nucleic acid molecule or several nucleic acid segments.
Also, the DNA or RNA may be single-stranded or double-stranded, and either linear or
circular.
Not all viruses can reproduce in a host cell by themselves. Since viruses are so small, the
size of their genome is limiting. For example, some viruses have coded instructions for only
making a few diﬀerent proteins for the viruses' capsid. On the other hand, the human
genome codes for over 30,000 diﬀerent proteins. Therefore, the lack of coded instructions
cause some viruses to need the presence of other viruses to help them reproduce themselves.
Such viruses are called replication defective.
Lastly, it is worthy to note that 70% of all viruses are RNA viruses. As the process of RNA
replication (with enzymes and other organelles of the host cell) is more prone to errors, RNA
viruses have much higher mutation rates than do DNA viruses.
22.4 Viruses Practice Questions
1. As the name implies, the Tomato Spotted Wilt Virus targets tomatoes. Would it be
possible for this virus to target other fruits as well? Explain.
2. If a DNA and a RNA virus both infected somatic cells, which virus would be more
diﬃcult to detect?
3. Many people have had cold sores, which are caused by infection with the herpes
simplex virus. One characteristic of cold sores is that after a period of inactivity, they
will reappear many times during the course of a person's life. Which cycle would the
herpes simplex virus undergo?
4. Chicken pox is a common, non-fatal disease usually acquired in adolescence and caused
by the varicella zoster virus. In adulthood, many people suﬀer from shingles, an altered
form of the varicella zoster virus. Which cycle would the varicella zoster virus have
undergone?
5. Would an antibiotic work for a person suﬀering from a cold of ﬂu? Explain.

100Domains of life: characteristics
22.7 Domains of life: characteristics
This text is based on notes very generously donated by Paul Doerder, Ph.D., of the Cleveland
State University.
22.8 Introduction
Out of the six kingdoms, Protista is the most diverse. This is the kingdom of organisms
with strange, atypical characteristics. In essence, this kingdom is designated for organisms
which do not belong in any other kingdom. The majority of protists are microscopic.
22.9 Classiﬁcation of Protists
There are three phyla of protists, based on their type of nutrition.
1. Protozoa (animal-like protists) are heterotrophs that ingest or absorb their food.
2. Algae (plant-like protists) are autotrophs they get nutrition from photosythesis.
3. Slime moulds and water moulds (fungus-like protists) are also heterotrophs, like
protozoa.
22.10 Protozoa
As heterotrophs, protozoa scavenge materials from their surroundings. Others are predators
which actively hunt or ambush small organisms such as bacteria and other protozoa for a
source of nutrition. Protozoa can be parasitic as well; they may live inside larger organisms,
like humans. Most protozoa live as single cells, although a few form colonies.
Protozoa are generally diﬃcult to identify due to their varied shape. They may appear as
jelly-like blobs, spherical sunbursts, or a ﬂattened leaf. Tiny blood parasites may be only 2
μm long. On the other hand, shell-covered marine may be 5 cm or more in diameter.
Furthermore, diﬀerent protozoans have their own complex life cycles. The complexity has
led certain organisms to be mistakenly classiﬁed for other species.
Nevertheless, protozoa can move, and so, they are classiﬁed based on their methods of
locomotion.
Characteristics of Protozoa :
• About 30,000 species known
• About 10,000 species are pathogenic, including some of the worst human diseases
• heterotrophic
• highly variable in form and life cycle
101Classiﬁcation of Living Things
• mostly unicellular
• range in size from 0.005 mm to 50 mm
• lack cell walls
they love environment and each other..............
22.11 Algae
Algae are much simpler than protozoa. They are aquatic and contain chlorophyll. Algae can
exist as a single cell or as giant seaweeds 60 m in length. Formerly, algae were classiﬁed as
plants but this was incorrect as algae lack parts of true plants: leaves, stems, roots, xylem,
and phloem. Since algae belong in the kingdom Protista, algae is a broad term used to
denote all aquatic eukaryotes which photosynthesise; algae can diﬀer in size and shape as
well.
There are six phyla of algae:chlorophytes (green algae), phaeophytes (brown algae),
rhodophytes (red algae), chrysophytes (diatoms), pyrrophytes (dinoﬂagellates),
and euglenophytes (euglenoids).
22.11.1 Chlorophytes
Chlorophytes resemble plants the most. Like plants, their cell walls contain cellulose and
they store food in reserve as starch. Chlorophytes can be unicellular or multicellular. Most
chlorophytes use ﬂagellae for some locomotion.
22.11.2 Phaeophytes
Phaeophytes are nearly all multicellular marine organisms, which are known to us as seaweeds.
They have cell walls composed of cellulose and alginic acid (a substance similar to pectin).
The cellulose and alignic acid help to retain water and prevent seawood from drying out
when exposed to air at low tide.
Since phaeophytes live in a tidal environment, they have large, ﬂat fronds (a large leaf)
which can withstand pounding by waves. Their bases strongly anchor the algae to the rocky
seabed and prevent them from being washed out to sea. Phaeophytes are usually found in
areas of cold water.
22.11.3 Rhodophytes
Rhodophytes are typically found in warmer seawater, and are more delicate and smaller
than brown algae (phaeophytes). Rhodophytes are also able to grow at deeper depths in
the ocean, since red algae absorb green, violet, and blue light, the wavelengths of which
penetrate the deepest below the water surface. They also have mucilaginous material to
resist drying.
102Slime molds & Water molds
22.11.4 Chryosophytes
Chryosophytes are the most abundant unicellular algae in the oceans. They are also one
of the biggest components of plankton, a free-ﬂoating collection of microorganisms, eggs,
and larvae. As photosynthetic organisms, they produce a signiﬁcant amount of atmospheric
oxygen.
The reproduction cycle of chryosophytes is particularly interesting. Note that diatoms
reproduce both asexually and sexually. Since diatoms have a rigid cell wall with an outer
layer of silica (found in sand and glass), the daughter cells produced by mitosis must ﬁt
inside the original cell wall. Therefore, each generation of diatoms is smaller than the one
before. The reduction in size continues until the diatoms produce sexually, producing a
zygote which eventually grows to the original size as it matures.
22.11.5 Pyrrophytes
Pyrrophytes are unicellular, photosynthetic, and mostly aquatic. They have protective coats
composed of stiﬀ cellulose. They are more easily identiﬁable, due to the presence of two
ﬂagellae. The longer ﬂagellae propels the dinoﬂagellate, while the second shorter, ﬂatter
ﬂagellae functions as a rudder.
Some species of pyrrophytes are zooxanthellae. Since they lack cellulose plates, they make
their home in coral reefs and animals, such as sea anemones, and molluscs. In returning
the favour of sheltering them, dinoﬂagellates provide carbohydrates to their host through
photosynthesis. This is why there are nutrient-rich coral reefs in malnutritions water.
A negative aspect of pyrrophytes is that under certain conditions, species of dinoﬂagellates
reproduce rapidly to form a harmful algal bloom (HAB), known as a red tide if dinoﬂag-
ellates are the cause. Such pyrrophytes can produce toxins which may injure or kill wildlife,
and additionally any consumers of contaminated wildlife.
22.11.6 Euglenophytes
Like pyrrophytes, euglenophytes are small unicellular freshwater organisms with two ﬂagella.
They are mainly autotrophic or heterotrophic, depending if they have a red, light-sensitive
structure called an eyespot.
22.12 Slime molds & Water molds
There are two phyla of slime moulds and one phylum of water moulds.
22.12.1 Oomycotes (Water moulds)
Oomycotes are ﬁlamentous organisms which resemble fungi, in that they live as saprotrophs.
Oomycotes diﬀer from other moulds with the presence of spores and their sexual life cycle.
103Classiﬁcation of Living Things
22.12.2 Myxomycotes (Plasmodial slime moulds)
Myxomycotiesarevisibletothenakedeyeastinyslug-likeorganismswhichcreepoverdecayed
and dead matter. This streaming blob containing many nuclei is called a plasmodium.
22.12.3 Acrasiomycotes (Cellular slime moulds) and its reproductive
cycle
Acrasiomycotes exist as individual amoeboid cells with one nucleus each. When in un-
favourable conditions, each acrasiomycete cell gathers together to form a pseudoplasmod-
ium.
Reproductive Cycle:
1. One acrasiomycete cell joins with others to form a pseudoplasmodium.
2. The pseudoplasmodium shrinks and forms a smaller plasmodium.
3. The plasmodium migrates to a suitable environment.
4. The plasmodium develops a sporangia, where original parental nuclei has divided by
meiosis into haploid spores to be germinated.
5. When favourable conditions arise, the spores germinate and are carried away by animals
or the wind.
6. Cycle repeats.

23.23 Introduction
Although you may not recognise fungi, they are just as prevalent as plants and animals.
Their spores are in the air which we breathe, fungi allow us to make bread, and mushrooms
(a type of fungi) are eaten by us. A few types of fungi are unicellular. For example, yeasts live
as individual oval or cylindrical cells. However, the majority of fungi live are multicellular.
Their bodies are composed of hyphae, a network of ﬁne ﬁlaments. In a mushroom, the
111Multicellular Photosynthetic Autotrophs
hyphae are densely packed so it is diﬃcult to see the individual structures when a mushroom
is eaten. However, a mushroom is only a specialised reproductive part of the whole fungus.
The main part of the fungi is underground in a whole web of hyphae, called a mycelium.
In the mycelium, each fungal cell is separated from each other by a septum. Each fungal
cell may have one or more nuclei and remains connected to the mycelium because the septa
are porous, allowing cytoplasm to ﬂow through the hyphae and fungal cell walls, made of a
hard material called chitin. Some fungi do not have septa, and they appear to be large,
branching, multinucleate cells.
23.24 Nutrition
Fungi are saprophytes. When they ﬁnd a source of food (e.g. dead wood, orange peel) ,
they decompose it and digest it. The enzymes break down larger organic molecules in the
substrate into smaller molecules. These smaller molecules diﬀuse into the fungus, where
they are used to allow growth and repair.
Fungi which feed on living cells are parasitic. For example, athlete's foot grows on the
human foot. These kinds of fungi produce hyphae called haustoria, which can penetrate
host cells without immediately killing them.
However, they are friendlier species of fungi. Many fungi live symbiotically with plants or
animals. For example, most trees have fungi living in close contact with their roots. In this
relationship, known as a mycorrhiza, there are many beneﬁts:
• Growing around the plant roots and often entering plant cells, the hyphae absorb minerals
from the soil and release them in the roots. The fungi gets its source of food (organic
nutrients) while delivering food to the plant.
• The mycelium here would increase the surface area, thus the absorptive surface, of the
plant roots.
• The fungal cells help to maintain air and water ﬂow in the soil around the roots.
• The fungi may prevent other potentially pathogenic fungi to attack the tree.
23.25 Fungal Reproduction
Fungi can reproduce in two ways. Firstly, they make asexually produce through frag-
mentation. This occurs when pieces of hyphae are broken oﬀ, which then grow into new
mycelia.
The second method is by spores. Spores are lightweight structures and windblown designed
to be transported over long distances and by many mediums, such as on the bodies of insects
and birds. They are additionally light enough to be blown away for hundreds of kilometers.
Spores may be asexual and sexual. Their sexual properties can be analysed to classify the
four phylla of fungi.
112Types of Fungi
23.26 Types of Fungi
23.26.1 Zygospore Fungi (Zygomycetes)
This phyllum includes bread moulds and other saprotrophs. Comparable to bacteria, this
phyllum prefers asexual reproduction over sexual reproduction.
1. Two haploid hyphae of opposite types, also known as mating strain + and mating
strain -, combine and fuse together.
2. Plasmogamy, the union of the two parent hyphae, occurs and results in the creation
of a heterokaryotic (n + n) zygosporangium or zygospore. Note that the zygospore is
NOT diploid yet; the haploid nuclei are simply clumped together.
3. Immediately, a thick wall develops around the zygospore to protect it from drying and
other hazards. The zygospore becomes dormant.
4. When conditions are favourable, the zygospore absorbs water and undergoes karyogamy
(n + n = 2n), where the haploid nuclei contributed by the two parents fuse to produce
diploid zygosporangia.
5. The now diploid zygosporangium then undergoes meiosis to form haploid sporangia.
6. Through asexual reproduction of fungi (See above for more information), the spores from
the sporangia germinate and grow into new mycelia.
7. Back to step #1.
23.26.2 Club Fungi (Basidiomycetes)
This phyllum increases mushrooms and shelf fungi. In many ways, the reproduction stages
of this phyllum is similar to that of zygomycetes.
1. Two haploid hyphae of opposite types, also known as mating strain + and mating
strain -, combine and fuse together.
2. Plasmogamy takes place, and a dikaryotic mycelium forms. The dikaryotic mycelium
grows faster then the haploid parental mycelia.
3. Environmental factors cause the dikaryotic mycelium to form compact masses which de-
velop into basidiocarps, short-lived reproductive structures. An example is the mushroom.
4. The basidiocarp gills are lined with terminal dikaryotic cells called basidia, which then
undergo karyogamy.
5. The basidia are now diploid. They undergo meiosis to develop haploid basidiospores, a
term referring to a basidiomycete's spores.
6. Stillremainingonthebasidiocarp, thehaploidbasidiosporeseject,fallfromthebasidiocarp,
and are dispersed by the wind when mature.
7. In a favourable environment, the basidiospores germinate and grow into short-lived
haploid mycelia.

23.27 Key Terms
synapomorphy
23.28 Introduction
What makes an animal an animal?
If animals are a monophyletic taxon, then animals should be able to be deﬁned by synapomor-
phies, (shared, derived characteristics). Ideally, we would NOT deﬁne this or any taxon using
symplesiomorphies (shared ancestral or primitive characteristics) or homoplastic characters
(the independent evolution of similarity, or "convergent evolution"). See pages 654 - 656 and
Fig. 32.6 in your text to review these concepts. As you consider the characteristics listed
below, ask yourself whether or not each is a synapomorphy.
23.29 Characteristics of an Animal
• There is no one universally accepted deﬁnition of an animal. The following treatment
follows your text, beginning on page 876.
• Animals:

Animals are multicellular heterotrophic eukaryotes
• Unfortunately, none of these traits is exclusive to animals:
• Plants, fungi, and some algae are multicellular.
• Many bacteria, protists, and all fungi are heterotrophic.
• Everything other than bacteria and archaea are eukaryotic.
• Moreover, all three of these characteristics also apply to fungi.
• However, there is a diﬀerence here between animals and fungi. Animals generally
take in their food through ingestion, or eating and swallowing something. Fungi are
absorptive heterotrophs; they secrete their digestive enzymes onto their food, and then
absorb the resulting nutrients.
Animals share unique characteristics
• Only animals have muscle tissue and nervous tissue.
• Only animals have collagen, a structural protein
• Only animals have the following types of intercellular junctions: (See pages 135 - 139,
Figure 7.15 in your text for more information on these junctions.)
114Characteristics of an Animal
• Tight junctions (sealing function)
• Desmosomes (anchoring function)
• Gap junctions (communication function)
Animals share certain reproductive characteristics
• Most animals reproduce sexually, with the diploid stage dominating.
• In most animals, a small, haploid, ﬂagellated, motile sperm fertilizes a larger, haploid,
nonmotile egg to form a diploid zygote.
• Mitotic division of the zygote yields a blastula stage, followed by a gastrula stage. A
synapomorphy? This feature could be another "unique characteristic" shared by animals.
• Development may be direct to adult form, or there may be a sexually immature stage
(or stages) that are morphologically & ecologically distinct from the adult called a larva
(plural: larvae).
Other commonly used deﬁnitions or characterizations
• It is surprisingly diﬃcult to ﬁnd two texts that agree on a precise deﬁnition of an animal.
Here are a few perspectives from some other texts.
• Animals are multicellular eukaryotes; they are chemosynthetic heterotrophs that ingest
their food.
• Animals are motile, though many are secondarily sessile. Gametes usually are produced
inmulticellularsexorgans, andthezygotepassesthroughembryonicstagesthatinclude
a blastula.
• Animals are organisms that are multicellular, with more than one type of cell. They
are heterotrophic. They reproduce sexually (at least sometimes), with a zygote formed
from two diﬀerent haploid gametes. They go through a developmental stage called a
blastula.
• Animals are not photosynthetic, have no cell wall, and no hyphae or mycelia. (What
would a cladist think of this deﬁnition of the taxon Animalia?)
What kinds of animals are there?
• Kingdom Animalia generally is recognized to have approximately 30 phyla ...
• There is relatively little dispute over the number of phyla recognized; however, the
phylogenetic relationships among the phyla are hotly debated.
• Molecular techniques for assess similarity based on nucleotide sequences in nucleic
acids are providing valuable new perspectives on this question.
• Remember that two animals in diﬀerent phyla generally are considered to be more diﬀerent
from each other than are animals within one phylum (e.g., nematodes are more diﬀerent
from annelids than humans are from sharks).

23.31 Phylum Porifera
Figure 6 Sponges
Name means "pore-bearing".
This phylum consists of the sponges. The number of species is estimated to be between
5,000 and 10,000. All are aquatic and almost all are marine.
Animals in this phyla have no true tissues, which means, for example, that they have no
nervous system or sense organs. Although sponges are multicellular, they are described as
being essentially at a cellular level of organization. They are sessile as adults, but have a
free swimming larva.
Their bodies are porous. They are ﬁlter feeders; water ﬂows in through many small openings,
and out through fewer, large openings. They have inner and outer cell layers, and a variable
middle layer. The middle layer often is gelatinous with spiny skeletal elements (called
spicules) of silica or calcium carbonate, and ﬁbres made of spongin (a form of collagen).
117Multicellular Photosynthetic Autotrophs
Choanocytes are ﬂagellated cells lining the inside of the body that generate a current, and
trap and phagocytize food particles.
Their cells remain totipotent, or developmentally ﬂexible: they can become any type of
cell at any point in the sponge's development. This allows for the great regenerative power
sponges have.
Sponges are an ancient group, with fossils from the early Cambrian (ca. 540 mya) and
possibly from the Precambrian. Sponges often are abundant in reef ecosystems. They
somehow are protected from predators (spicules? bad taste?).
Many organisms are commensals of sponges, living inside them. Some sponges harbor
endosymbiotic cyanobacteria or algae (dinoﬂagellates, a.k.a. "zooxanthellae").
23.32 Phylum Cnidaria
See text pages 886 - 889.
Name comes from the Greek knide- meaning "nettle".
This phylum They have one opening, which serves as both mouth and anus. The body wall
has an outer ectoderm, an inner endoderm, and a variable undiﬀerentiated middle layer
called mesoglea or mesenchyme that may be jelly-like. The mesoglea is NOT considered
to be true mesoderm and so the Cnidaria are described as diploblastic. Tentacles usually
extend from the body wall around the mouth/anus.
118Phylum Cnidaria
Figure 7 Jellyﬁsh Development
14 15
There are two basic body plans: the polyp and the medusa . The polyp is sessile and
attaches to substrate by the aboral end (i.e., the end away from the mouth). The medusa
("jellyﬁsh") is a ﬂoating form, and looks like an upside-down version of the polyp. Some
cnidarians only have the polyp stage, some have only the medusa stage, and others have
both.
14 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polyp
15 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medusa%20%28biology%29
119Multicellular Photosynthetic Autotrophs
The typical life cycle of a cnidarian involves what is called "alternation of generations": an
alternation between an asexual polyp stage and a sexual medusa stage.
The tentacles are armed with cnidae (or nematocysts), small intracellular "harpoons" that
function in defense and prey capture. When ﬁred, the cnidae deliver a powerful toxin that
in some cases is dangerous to humans. The phylum is named after the cnidae.
Cnidarians have no head, no centralized nervous system, and no specialized organs for gas
exchange, excretion, or circulation. They do have a "nerve net."
Many cnidarians have intracellular algae living within them in a mutualistic symbiotic
relationship (Dinoﬂagellates = zooxanthellae). This combination is responsible for much of
the primary productivity of coral reefs.
There are three main classes in the phylum
16
• Class Hydrozoa (hydras and Portugese man-of-war are well-known but atypical examples
of this Class)
17
• Class Scyphozoa (jellyﬁsh)
• The medusa stage is dominant and the polyp stage often is reduced.
18
• Class Anthozoa (sea anemones, most corals)
• No medusa (jellyﬁsh) stage, so sexual reproduction occurs in the polyp stage in this
group. The polyps also can reproduce asexually, which is how individual "corals" grow.
23.33 Phylum Platyhelminthes
See text pages 890 - 893.
Name means "ﬂat worm"
Most members of this phylum are parasitic (ﬂukes and tapeworms), but some are free living
(e.g., planaria). There are about 20,000 species.
They are dorsoventrally compressed (i.e., "ﬂat").
Animals in this phylum are acoelomate, triploblastic, bilaterally symmetrical, and unseg-
mented. Platyhelminths have a simple anterior "brain" and a simple ladder-like nervous
system. Their gut has only one opening. Flatworms have NO circulatory or gas exchange
systems. They do have simple excretory/osmoregulatory structures (protonephridia or "ﬂame
cells").
Platyhelminths are hermaphroditic, and the parasitic species often have VERY complex
reproductive (life) cycles.
There are four main classes of platyhelminths:
19
• Class Turbellaria (mostly free living ﬂatworms, e.g., planaria)
16 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrozoa
17 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scyphozoa
18 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthozoa
19 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbellaria
120Phylum Rotifera
20
• Class Monogenea (parasitic ﬂukes)
21
• Class Trematoda (parasitic ﬂukes, e.g., liver ﬂuke and the human blood ﬂuke, Schisto-
soma)
22
• Class Cestoda (tapeworms)
• Cestodes are endoparasitic in the gut of vertebrates. They do not have a mouth or
digestive system.
23.34 Phylum Rotifera
See text page 900
The Rotifers. The name means "wheel bearing," a reference to the corona, a feeding structure
(see below).
They are triploblastic, bilaterally symmetrical, and unsegmented. They are considered
pseudocoelomates.
Most less than 2 mm, some as large as 2 - 3 mm.
Rotifers have a three part body: head, trunk foot. The head has a ciliary organ called the
corona that, when beating, looks like wheels turning, hence the name of the phylum. The
corona is a feeding structure that surrounds the animal's jaws. The gut is complete (i.e.,
mouth & anus), and regionally specialized. They have protonephridia but no specialized
circulatory or gas-exchange structures.
Most live in fresh water, a very few are marine or live in damp terrestrial habitats. They
typically are very abundant. There are about 2,000 species.
Parthenogenesis, where females produce more females from unfertilized but diploid eggs, is
common. Males may be absent (as in bdelloid rotifers) or reduced. When males are present,
sexual and asexual life cycles alternate. Males develop from unfertilized haploid eggs and
are haploid. Males produce sperm by mitosis which can fertilize haploid eggs, yielding a
diploid zygote that develops into a diploid female. Sexual reproduction occurs primarily
when living conditions are unfavorable.
Most structures in rotifers are syncytial ("a mulitnucleate mass of protoplasm not divided into
separate cells," or "a multinucleated cell") and show eutely (here, "constant or near-constant
number of nuclei").
23.35 Phylum Nematoda
See text pages 894 - 895.
Name from the Greek for "thread".
20 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monogenea
21 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trematoda
22 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cestoda
121Multicellular Photosynthetic Autotrophs
This phylum consists of the round worms. There are about 12,000 named species but the
true number probably is 10 - 100 times this!
These animals are triploblastic, bilaterally symmetrical, unsegmented pseudocoelomates.
They are vermiform, or wormlike.
In cross-section, they are round, and covered by a layered cuticle (remember this cuticle !!).
Probably due to this cuticle, juveniles in this phylum grow by molting. The gut is complete.
They have a unique excretory system but they lack special circulatory or gas-exchange
structures. The body has only longitudinal muscle ﬁbers. The sexes are separate.
Nematodes can be incredibly common, widespread, and of great medical and economic
importance. They are parasites of humans and our crops. They can live pretty much
anywhere.
In one rotting apple, there can be up to 90,000 nematodes, and in one tablespoon of coastal
mud, there can be 236 species of nematodes!
Nematodes can be free living or important parasites of our crops, or of humans and other
animals. They have become very important in development studies, especially the species
Caenorhabditis elegans, presumably due to its small size and constancy of cell number
(eutely - 959 cells in C. elegans).
23.36 Phylum Annelida
See text pages 906 - 909.
Name means "ringed", from the Greek annulatus.
This phylum consists of earthworms, leeches, and various marine worms given many diﬀerent
names (e.g., sand worms, tube worms). There are about 12,000 - 15,000 species.
Animals in this phylum are triploblastic, bilaterally symmetrical, segmented coelomates.
Development is typically protostomous. They have a complete circulatory system, and
a well-developed nervous system. Typically, each segment has paired epidermal "bristles"
(setae or chaetae).
Most are marine but they are successful occupants of almost anywhere suﬃcient water is
available. They can be free living, parasitic, mutualistic, or commensalistic.
Major advances of this phylum include the true coelom, segmentation, both longitundinal
and circular muscles, a closed circulatory system and, for most, a more advanced excretory
system (metanephridia).
There are three main classes of Annelids
• Class Oligochaeta (earthworms)
• Class Polychaeta (marine worms)
• Class Hirudinea (leeches)
122Phylum Arthropoda
23.37 Phylum Arthropoda
Figure 8 Arthropods
Name means "jointed feet".
This phylum consists of spiders, ticks, mites, insects, lobsters, crabs, and shrimp, and is the
largest of all the phyla. So far, over 1 million species have been named, and it is likely that
the true number out there is 10 - 100 times greater.
This phylum also includes the extinct trilobites, which were prevalent in the Paleozoic era.
Because of their exoskeletons, these animals fossilized well and over 4000 species have been
named.
These animals are triploblastic, bilaterally symmetrical, segmented, protostome coelomates.
The coelom is generally reduced to portions of the reproductive and excretory systems. They
have an open circulatory system.
Themostnotableadvancementofthisphylumisarigidexoskeleton. Ithasmajorimplications
in these organisms' locomotion, ﬂexibility, circulatory systems, gas exchange systems, and
growth. It also was partially responsible for the ability of the arthropods to move on to land.
There are several major groupings of arthropods:
Major subgroups include:
• The chelicerates (eurytperids, horseshoe crabs, scorpions, spiders, ticks) have clawlike
feeding appendages. They lack antennae and usually have simple eyes.
• The Trilobites...they get their own grouping
123Multicellular Photosynthetic Autotrophs
• The uniramians (centipedes, millipedes, insects) have one pair of antennae and un-
branched (uniramous) appendages.
• The crustaceans (crabs, shrimp, lobsters, barnacles and many others) have two pairs of
antennae and branched (biramous) appendages.
Major Classes Include
• Class Arachnida (mites, scorpions, spiders, ticks)
• Class Diplopoda (millipedes)
• Class Chilopoda (centipedes)
• Class Insecta (insects)
• Class Crustacea (crabs, crayﬁsh, lobsters, shrimp)
23.38 Phylum Mollusca
See text pages 900 - 905.
Name means "soft".
This phylum consists of snails, slugs, bivalves, chitons, squids, octopus, and many others.
About 110,000 species
All molluscs have a similar body plan:
• A muscular foot, usually used for movement.
• A visceral mass, containing most of the internal organs.
• A mantle, a fold of tissue that drapes over the visceral mass and secretes the shell, if
present.
• Most have a radula, or a rasping organ to scrape food.
Molluscs are bilaterally symmetrical, or secondarily asymmetrical. They are coelomates, but
the coelom generally has been greatly reduced; the main body cavity is a hemocoel. Devel-
opment is typically protostomous. The gut is complete with marked regional specialization.
Large, complex, metanephridia (excretion).
Many molluscan life cycles include a trochophore larva. This stage also is characteristic of
annelids.
There are several major classes of molluscs:
• Class Polyplacophora (chitons)
• Class Gastropoda (snails, slugs, nudibranchs)
• Class Bivalvia (clams, mussels, scallops, oysters)
• Class Cephalopoda (squids, octopuses, chambered nautiluses)
23.39 Phylum Echinodermata
Name means "spiny skin"
This phylum consists of sea stars, brittle stars, sea urchins, and sea cucumbers.
124Phylum Chordata
Echinoderms are mostly sessile or very slow moving animals.
As adults, they are radially symmetrical, but in the larval stage, they are bilaterally
symmetrical. They are considered deuterostomes.
Echinoderms are unique in that they have a water vascular system composed of a system
of ﬂuid-ﬁlled canals. These canals branch into the tube feet, which function in feeding,
locomotion, and gas exchange.
There are six major classes of echinoderms:
• Class Asteroidea (sea stars)
• Class Ophiuroidea (brittle stars)
• Class Echinoidea (sea urchins, sand dollars)
• Class Crinoidea (sea lilies)
• Class Holothuroidea (sea cucumbers)
23.40 Phylum Chordata
Name means "the chordates", i.e., these animals have a notochord at some stage in their
lifecycle.
This phylum consists of tunicates, lancelets, and the vertebrates.
There are four major features that characterize the phylum Chordata.
• A notochord, or a longitudinal, ﬂexible rod between the digestive tube and the nerve
cord. In most vertebrates, it is replaced developmentally by the vertebral column. This
is the structure for which the phylum is named.
• A dorsal hollow nerve cord which develops from a plate of ectoderm that rolls into a tube
located dorsal to the notochord. Other animal phyla have solid nerve cords ventrally
located. A chordate nerve cord splits into the central nervous system: the brain and
spinal cord.
• Pharyngeal slits, which allow water that enters through the mouth to exit without
continuing through the entire digestive tract. In many of the invertebrate chordates,
these function as suspension feeding devices; in vertebrates, they have been modiﬁed for
gas exchange, jaw support, hearing, and other functions.
• A muscular, postanal tail which extends posterior to the anus. The digestive tract of
most nonchordates extends the length of the body. In chordates, the tail has skeletal
elements and musculature, and can provide most of the propulsion in aquatic species.
Chordates have a segmented body plan, at least in development. This segmentation evolved
independently from the segmentation of annelids.
Three subphyla make up the phylum Chordata:
• Subphylum Urochordata (tunicates): the adults are enclosed in a tunic made of a carbo-
hydrate much like cellulose. They squirt water out of an excurrent siphon. Urochordates
are characterized by errant (mobile and active) larvae and sessile adults. All are ﬁlter
feeders. The only "chordate" characteristics retained in adult life are the pharyngeal slits.
125Multicellular Photosynthetic Autotrophs
Larval urochordates look more like adult cephlochordates & adult vertebrates than adult
urochordates.
• Subphylum Cephalochordata: Cephalochordates are known as lancelets because of their
blade-like shape; they are also known as amphioxus. They are marine animals and usually
live on the bottom, but can swim.
• Subphylum Vertebrata (vertebrates) ...
Formally, the phyla Urochordata and Cephalochordata are considered invertebrates.
23.40.1 Subphylum Vertebrata
Vertebrata refers to the presence of vertebrae and a vertebral column.
This subphylum includes most of the animals with which most people are familiar.
Vertebrates show extreme cephalization.
The notochord generally is replaced by the cranium & vertebral column in adults.
Neural Crest Cells
Later in development, these give rise to many cells of the body, including some cartilage
cells, pigment cells, neurons & glial cells of the peripheral nervous systems, much of the
cranium, and some of the cells of the endocrine system.
Some scientists would like to classify the neural crest as the fourth germ layer.
Neural crest cells come from the dorsal edge of the neural plate, thus ectoderm.
12624 Chordates
The phylum Chordata includes three subphyla. These include vertebrates and invertebrate
chordates.
24.1 Characteristics
Notochord: the rod-shaped supporting axis found in the dorsal part of the embryos of all
chordates, including vertebrates
Flexible, non-collapsible rod dorsal to the gut/coelom and below the nervous system,
hydrostatic, ﬂuid wrapped in tough connective tissue. As bone does not compact, muscles
tensed on one side result in movement instead of shortening the animal. This allows much
better locomotion than do cilia for larger animals in water, a crucial victory for later success.
Pharyngeal slits: Slits in the pharynx originally used to gather food, water enters the mouth,
passes through pharynx and out gill-like slits, passing through a cavity called an antrium
and then outside. In humans, present only in embryo.
Dorsal nerve cord: A neural tube dorsal to the notochord
Postanal tail: Elongation of the body and notochord, nerve cord and muscles past anus into
tail, early locomotive function led to success.
Non-synapomorphic characteristics (not limited to chordates):
• bisymmetrical (bilateral symmetry)
• segmented muscles and bones
24.2 Subphylum Urochordata
The tunicates are located in this subphylum. Along with the subphylum Cephalochordata,
these two subphyla make up the invertebrate chordates. Only the tunicate larvae have
notochords, nerve cords, and postanal tails. Most adult tunicates are sessile, ﬁlter-feeders
which retain their pharyngeal slits. Adult tunicates also develop a sac, called a tunic,
which gives tunicates their name. Cilia beating within the turnicate cause water to enter
the incurrent siphon. The water enters the body, passes through the pharyngeal slits,
and leaves the body through the excurrent siphon. Undigested food is removed through
the anus. Tunicates are hemaphrodites and can reproduce asexually through budding.In
urochordates notochord is conﬁned to larval tail.These lack cranium. These have an open
type of circulatory system.Excretion is by neural gland,nephrocytes.
127Chordates
24.3 Subphylum Cephalochordata
The lancelets are located in this subphylum. Along with the subphylum Urochordata, these
two subphyla make up the invertebrate chordates. Lancelets receive their name from their
bladelike shape. They resemble ﬁsh but they are actually scaleless chordates only a few
centimeters long. They spend most of their time buried in the sand with their mouths
protruding. Fossils of lancelets have been found to be over 550 million years old.
Dropped out sessile stage, what was the larval stage is now sexually reproductive. Includes
Branchiostoma (“amphioxus”).
24.4 Subphylum Vertebrata
(Vertebra from Latin vertere, to turn). Characterized by separate bones or cartilage blocks
ﬁrmly joined as a backbone. The backbone supports and protects a dorsal nerve cord.
Vertebrates have tissues which are organized into organs which in turn are organized into
organ systems.
All vertebrates share the following characteristics: - segmentation - a true coelom - bilateral
symmetry-cephalization-abackbone-abonyskull-aclosedcirculatorysystem-chambered
heart - two pairs of jointed appendages - tissues organized into organs
Vertebrate Organ Systems: - Nervous System - Circulatory System - Digestive System -
Respiratory System - Reproductive System - Excretory System
• Vertebral column: Not present in higher vertebrate adults. (In humans, the gel-like,
spongy core of the vertebral column is the only remainder. Ruptured or herniated disc is
an injury to this.)
• Cranium: Composite structure of bone/cartilage. Two functions: 1. Supports sensory
organs of head and 2. Encloses or partially encloses the brain.
What evolutionary relationship could we imagine between sessile echinoderms and the higher
chordate animals?
Paedomorphic (child-form) hypothesis: basically, evolution of sexual reproduction in what
had previously been a larval life stage, or the retention of at least one juvenile characteristic
into the adult (adult = sexually reproducing) stage. Some scientists believe that this occurred
in a proto-chordate animal lineage. Maybe chordates (and vertebrates) arose from sessile
(attached) ancestors. Selection in these proto-chordates maybe began to favor more time in
the larval stage, as feeding was more successful or mortality lower in this stage. As larvae
got bigger physics shows that the cilia become less eﬃcient for locomotion, favoring the
undulating motion allowed by a notochord.
Is this hypothesis crazy? A similar example of this today is Epemeroptera, the mayﬂy, which
has almost abandoned its adult stage. Its one-year lifespan is mostly larval with just a brief
day of reproduce-and-die as an adult, which doesn’t even have usable mouthparts.
Tunicate (sea squirt) larva has all four chordate characteristics, although adult sessile
(“attached”).
128Subphylum Vertebrata
24.4.1 Class Agnatha
"jawless ﬁsh"
• Ostracoderms: extinct Agnathans which had primitive ﬁns and massive plates of bony
tissue on their body.
• Cyclostomes: "circle mouth" - a group of Agnathans which is still alive in the form of
lampreys and hagﬁsh.
Appeared approximately 500 million years ago and dominated the oceans for about 100
million years. The ﬁrst group of ﬁsh to appear. They had neither jaws, paired ﬁns, nor
scales, but they were the ﬁrst organisms with a backbone.
Class Acanthodia
"spiny ﬁsh" Appeared about 430 million years ago. An extinct class of ﬁsh that developed
jaws with bony edges. They had internal skeletons made of cartilage and some bone.
Class Placodermi
Appeared about 410 million years ago, dominated the sea for about 50 million years. An
extinct class of ﬁsh with massive heads.
24.4.2 Class Chondrichthyes
"cartilaginous ﬁsh" Appeared about 400 million years ago with bony ﬁsh. Includes sharks,
skates and rays, and chimaeras. Their skeletons are made of cartilage strengthened by the
mineral calcium carbonate.
The main characteristics and distinguishing features of this class: - gills - single-loop blood
circulation - vertebral column - presence of placoid scales on their bodies - internal skeleton
of cartilage - paired, ﬂeshy pectoral and pelvic ﬁns - asymmetrical tail ﬁn prevents sinking -
fatty liver provides neutral buoyancy - visceral clefts present as separate and distinct gills -
no external ear - oviparous - internal fertilization - ectoderms - cold blooded

folding of enamel.
• Skeleton made of bone, jaws, ﬁns, most with scales, two-chambered heart.
24.4.4 Class Amphibia
means “both lives”, aquatic larvae, terrestrial adult Amphibians: - Legs - Lungs - Double-
Loop Circulation - Partially Divided Heart - Cutaneous Respiration (Breathes through
Skin)

salamanders (tailed)
Labyrinthodont amphibians: oldest known amphibians, inherited characteristic teeth from
crossopterygii ancestor, had stocky, aquatic larvae.
Amphibians have limbs instead of ﬁns. Girdles and vertebral column now more substantial
and connected, support body on legs.
Lisamphybia: no scales, “smooth”, eggs with no shell, laid in water (water-reliant).
Amphibians gave rise to cotylosaurs, from which arose dinosaurs, turtles, lizards, and
therapsids.
Class Reptilia
amniotic egg allowed freedom from water, shelled egg. (Amnion: protection). Reptiles have
four extra-embryonic membranes:
• Amnion: supports aquatic environment inside egg in ﬂuid sac.
• Allantois: allows gas exchange and elimination of wastes.
• Chorion: gas exchange
• Yolk sac: only one of the four left over from amphibian ancestor
Reptiles cold-blooded, or ectothermic, meaning that their heat come from their environment.
Sometimes deﬁned as all amniotes that are not birds or mammals.
Reptiles can be classiﬁed by skull structure into four groups:
• Anapsid
• Synapsid
• Diapsid
• Euryasid
130Subphylum Vertebrata
Refers to number of holes in the skull. Cotylosaurs had Anapsid skull
Dermatocranium: from bony outer skull structure, precursor to human cranium.
Subclass Anapsidia
Subclass Testudinata

turtles , terrapins
Subclass Diapsida

dinosaurs , snakes , most stuﬀ
Subclass Synapsida
Order Therapsids
Subclass Diapsida
includes Ichthyosaurs, marine reptiles convergent on dolphins; Plesiosaurs, ancient sea
monsters; Squamates, including lizards and snakes; and Thecodonts, which gave rise to
• birds
• dinosaurs
• crocodilians
Dinosaurs: broken into two groups, based on hip structure
• Saurischia: lizard hips (gave rise to birds [!]), ancestrally bipedal
• Ornithischian: bird hips, ancestrally quadripedal
Crocodilians: come from archosaurs, the only extant (still living today) archosaur descendant.
Ancestrally bipedal, secondarily quadripedal.
Synapsids: refers to joined (Greek syn-, together with) parts of skull. Led eventually to
mammals. Synapsid pelycosaur >> therapsid >> mammals
Pelycosaur: Sail-backed dinosaur, legs not spread out like lizard but more pillar-like and
under body, allowing greater activity and competence in motion, pendulum like rather than
constant push-up. Teeth diﬀerentiated into diﬀerent types, for pre-processing of food needed
by higher metabolism. Skull changes, bone histology, suggestions of warm-bloodedness.

131Chordates
Class Aves
arose late Jurassic, early Cretaceous. Feathers, skeleton modiﬁed for ﬂight. Feathers:
epidermal derivative, made of keratin (like ﬁngernails). Carpometacarpis: bears primary
ﬂight feathers, parallel to hand parts. Keeled sternum: breastbone, powerful one needed
to support ﬂight muscles. Strong, light, occasionally hollow bones. All birds lay eggs (as
contrasted to reptiles, which have developed live birthing over 100 independent times.) Why
are there no live-bearing birds? Early birds had teeth, lost them. With mammals, only
exothermic animals.
Archaeopteryx: “ancient wing”, Jurassic bird-reptile, very dinosaur-like. Good fossils found
in Zolenhoﬀen, German sandstone mine with ﬁne sand, shows feathers clearly, found shortly
after Darwin’s publication and used to support his hypothesis. Thick, heavy bones and no
sternum, bony tail, not a good ﬂyer but did have primary ﬂight feathers.
Archaeornithes: includes archaeopteryx.
Paleognathae: gave rise to Australian ﬂightless birds.
Neognathae: remaining live birds.
Class Mammalia
Two unique characteristics, or synapomorphies:
• Hair
• Mammary glands
(don’t fossilize well)
Three skeletal characteristics (fossilize)
• Lower jaw only one bone, the dentary (several in reptiles)
• Three bones in middle ear: malleus, incus, stapes (reptiles have one or two, never three)
• Joint between upper and lower jaws between dentary and squamosal of skull (in reptiles
this joint is between other bones)
Mammals basically have a synapsid skull design inherited from ancestor
Non diagnostic characteristics (not unique to mammals):
• Warm-blooded
• Skin glands: sweat glands and oil-producing sebaceous glands
• Large nasal cavities (because of high metabolism) Clean, warm and humidify air
• Heterodonty (diﬀerentiated teeth)
• Diphiodonty: two sets of teeth: baby and adult (“deciduous” teeth, drop out) (reptile
teeth are continually replaced)
Subclass Protheria
monotremes (Greek mon-, one; and trema, hole), or egg-laying mammals, have one opening
for excretion and urination.
132Subphylum Vertebrata
Subclass Theria
Metatheria: Marsupials (opossum, kangaroo...) Eutheria: Placental mammals (all common
mammals)
Marsupium: (from Greek marsypion, purse or pouch). Gestation period much shorter than
in Eutherian mammals, but after leaving the uterus the tiny oﬀspring crawls into a pouch
where it completes development latched onto a teat.
Recent molecular (read: genetic) evidence suggests that two diﬀerent mammal groups
may have developed live-bearing ability separately. Instead of being a “rough draft” for
placental-style live bearing, perhaps the marsupial pouch approach is another solution to
the same problem. Advantage: in tough times the parent can pitch out the oﬀspring and
increase its own chance of survival.
13325 Tissues and Systems
13526 Epithelial tissue
Comes from various sources, ectodermal or endodermal material. Cell sheet lines a
surface or body cavity. One side, called freesurface or Apical, is exposed to
• animal interior (forming the lumen) or
• exterior of its body cavity.
The other side rests on the basal layer.
Epithelial tissue is not penetrated by blood vessels.
Two categories:
• sheets
• glands
Classiﬁed on two features:
• simple, (a single layer of cells),
• stratiﬁed, (more than one cell layer.)
Cell shape at free surface:
• squamous (broad and ﬂat)
• cuboidal (spherish)
• columnar (tall and thin)
Simple squamous epithelium
usually lines body cavities and vessels,alveoli, glomeruli of kidney; in blood and lymph
vessels called endothelium; in body cavities called mesothelium (serosae): parietal serous
membranes line body wall, visceral serous membranes cover organ
Simple cuboidal epithelium
in ducts like kidney and salivary glands.
Simple columnar epithelium
nonciliated type lines digestive tract, ciliated type lines some regions of uterine tubes and
lungs
Stratiﬁed squamous epithelium
(important) lines mouth, esophagus,and vagina. Cells sometimes dead, ﬂat and keratinized,
making them resistant to abrasion. Stratiﬁed squamous epithelium changes to columnar
squamous epithelium progressively down esophagus to the stomach.
Epidermis
137Epithelial tissue
from epithelium. Below this is dermis, thicker and with blood vessels.
Two specialized epithelia:
• pseudostratiﬁed
• transitional
Pseudostratiﬁed epithelia
lines the trachea (where it is ciliated)and the male urethra (where it is non ciliated), looks
stratiﬁed but not.
Transitional epithelia
found only in bladder and urinary system. As it stretches it appears to go from 6 to 3 cell
layers deep.
Glandular epithelia
(gland: group of cells that excretes something.. mostly derived from epithelium. Glands
are classiﬁed into endocrine and exocrine by where they excrete.
Endocrine glands
secrete hormones into the blood without use of ducts.
Exocrine glands
secrete onto the body surface or into a cavity, thru a duct. Exocrine substances include
sweat, mucous, oil, and saliva. An exocrine gland is the liver, which secretes bile.
13827 Connective tissue
This is a “grab bag” category of diverse tissue types. Functions include binding and
supporting. Types include bone, cartilage, ﬁbrous connective tissue, blood and
adipose (fat) tissue.
If you took away everything in the body except the connective tissue, you’d still be able to
see the basic form of the body.
Form: distinctivecellssurroundedbyacellmatrixmadeofextra-cellularﬁbergrounded
in a ground substance (excluding blood)
Types:
1. connectile connective tissues (can be 1. loose or 2. dense)
2. special connective tissue (includes blood, bones and cartilage).
Fibroblasts form connective tissue proper;
chondoroblasts form cartilage;
osteoblasts form bone;
and blood is formed from various sources.
Ground substance: “unstructured” material that ﬁlls space between cells and contains
ﬁbers. Made of
1. interstitial ﬂuid (bathes cells)
2. proteoglycans (protein core with attached polysaccharides, glycoaminoglycans or GAGs
such as chondroitin sulfate, keratin sulfate, and hyalronic acid, whose consistency is syrupy
to gelatin-like)
3. cell-adhesion proteins (connect connective tissue cells to the ﬁbers).
Fibers of connective tissue:
139Connective tissue
1. Collagen (ﬂexible protein resistant to stretching, tensile strength, most abundant
protein in animals, white)
2. elastin (rubbery, resilient protein, in dermis, lungs, blood vessels, yellow when fresh)
3. andreticulin (like collagen).
Loose connective tissue: found beneath skin, anchors muscles,nerves etc. Include ﬁ-
broblasts, macrophages, mast cells,and adipose cells. Fibers include collagen and
elastic ﬁbers. Ground substance is “syrupy”. Adipose included.
Dense connective tissue: largely densely packed ﬁbers of collagen or elastin regularly
or irregularly arranged. Forms tendons and ligaments, coverings of muscles, capsules
around organs and joints, and dermis of skin.
Cartilage vs. bone
Feature Bone Cartilage
cell type osteocytes chondrocytes
ground substance calcium phosphate chondroitin sulfate
vascularization vascular avascular
micro architecture highly ordered less organized
units called osteons
ﬁbrous sheath peristeum perichondrium
Cartilage: There are three cartilage types:
1. hyaline cartilage
2. ﬁbrocartilage (ﬁbrous cartilage)
3. elastic cartilage
Hyaline cartilage: most widespread cartilage type, in adults forms articular surfaces of
long bones, rib tips, rings of trachea, and parts of skull. Mostly collagen, name refers to
glassy appearance. In embryo, bones form ﬁrst as hyaline cartilage, later ossiﬁes. Found
in tracheal rings. Few collagen ﬁbers.
Fibrous cartilage: have lots of collagen ﬁbers. Found in intervertebral discs, pubic
symphesis. Grades into dense tendon and ligament tissue.
Elastic cartilage: springy and elastic. Found in internal support of external ear and in
epiglottis, yellow when fresh.
Chondrocites (cartilage cells) rely on diﬀusion for nutrients, as cartilage has no direct
blood supply, and no enervation (nerves). Can be loaded with calcium salts.
140Subphylum Vertebrata
Bone: Specialized connective tissue, calcium phosphate arranged in highly ordered unit
called osteon, or Hyvercian system. Concentric rings around central canal with blood
vessels and enervation (nerves). Bone varied, not all vertebrate bone is even cellular. Our
concern: simple pattern for mammals.
Lacuna (spaces in which osteocytes found); canaliculi (little canals) bigger diagonal cells,
layers of bone called lamellae.
Three types of bone cells, ending in
-blast, (mend bone)
-cyte (fortify bone)
-clast (tear down bone)
Classiﬁed by
1. appearance (spongy vs. hard)
2. where found (outside or inside)
3. how it is formed (endochondral cartilage model forms ﬁrst and then is ossiﬁed, and
entramembranous, bone forms directly without cartilage precursor)
Example of endochondral bone formation: long bone begins to ossify from center shaft,
calciﬁed region expands and cuts oﬀ diﬀusion of nutrients as bone replaces cartilage. In
young mammals, secondary ossiﬁcation centers then form at bone ends, growth has stopped
by sexual maturity as all primary bone is ossiﬁed. In other animals, bones continue growing
throughout their lifetime.
Three types of intramembrous bone:
1. dermal bone
2. sessamoid bone
3. perichondral bone.
Dermal bone forms skull, shoulder/pectoral girdle, and integument, descended from dermal
armor of ancestor. Comes from mesoderm, in dermis of skin.
Sessamoid bones: form directly in tendons. Example: kneecap, also in wrist. Deals with
stress.
Perichondral bone means “around cartilage,” forms around cartilage or bone. Func-
tions in bone repair and in ossiﬁcation of endochondral bone.
141Connective tissue
Bone remodeling and repair: bone has mineral structure, and develops tiny fractures,
which, under stress, can lead to larger fractures. To combat this, bone is constantly replaced.
Osteoclasts channel through existing bone, tear down and leave behind osteoblasts
and lacuna, leaving osteocytes. Continually resets mineral structure of bone, and is
preventative maintenance.
When bone broken, callus forms in open ends, periosteum gives rise to new bone with
calcium and new bone matrix, leaves irregular mend. Later, osteoblasts continue ﬁxing over
time and slowly removing imperfection.
14228 Muscle tissue
Mesodermal in origin, muscle has several functions: supply force for movement,restrain
movement, proper posture, act on viscera (internal organs) for peristalsis (moving food
down digestive tract), give body shape, form sphincters, (such as in esophagus, between
stomach and intestine, large and small intestine, in anus), in sheets of muscles, aﬀect air
ﬂow in and out of lungs, line blood vessels and play vital role in circulation.
Secondary roles: heat production (shivering a specialized heat production to supplement
metabolism).
Muscles co-opted to other non-original functions: sharks detect electrical ﬁeld created by ﬁsh
muscles. Some ﬁsh formed electric organs, create current strong enough to repel predators
or stun prey. Other ﬁsh can use ﬁeld as “radar” to see things and communicate with other
animals. (Evolved independently in diﬀerent groups).
Diﬀerent classiﬁcations: by color, (red or white) location, nature of nervous system
control (voluntary or involuntary), embryonic origin, or by general microscopic ap-
pearance (striated, smooth, and cardiac.)
Striated muscle (or skeletal muscle): under voluntary control. Individual cells called
ﬁbers, grouped into fascicle. Myoﬁbrils founding one cell made of even smaller myoﬁl-
aments. Each striated cell very long and multi-nucleated. Fibers joined end to end to
form longer composite ﬁbers. Sarcomeres: repeating units make up myoﬁbrils. Two
kinds of myoﬁlaments, thick kind made up of myosin and thin of actin. Striations visible
in light microscope, smaller part only with electron microscope.
Cardiac muscle: occurs only in heart. Light banding visible under light microscope.
Each band short, principally mononucleate (occasionally dinucleate) often branched, joined
together with intercollated discs. Involuntary. Waves of contraction spread through intercol-
lated discs. Initiated by nerve stimulation or can originate in the heart itself (useful in heart
transplants.)
Smooth muscle: no striations visible with light microscope. Almost entirely visceral
function: digestion, sphincters, urogenital tracts, piloerectory muscles (make hairs stand up),
lungs. Non-voluntary control. Slow and sustained action. Each cell mononucleate, short,
fusiform (spindly) in shape, cells usually uniform in size.
Striated muscle contraction: Muscle broken into units called fascicles, in units of myoﬁbrils.
Repeating units called sarcomeres, consisting of two kinds of myoﬁlaments:
1. thick, myosin ﬁlament
2. thin, actin ﬁlament.
143Muscle tissue
Sarcomere: Thick and thin ﬁlaments interspersed in ordered grid.
Sliding ﬁlament theory: thick and thin ﬁlaments move past each other in opposite
direction, shortening length. Longer muscles contract more rapidly than short ones (see cell
bio for details).
Myosin molecule: two polypeptides twisted together with two globular heads at end.
Myosin ﬁlament: many slender myosin molecules together.
Actin ﬁlament: chain of actin single, tropomyosin strands with repeated globular
troponin, and with actin. All play role in muscle contraction. Myocin heads have sites
that bind to actin. Actin ﬁlaments have many regular sites that can bind to myosin.
Troponin has four sites:
1. one to bind myosin
2. one for actin
3. one for tropomyocin
4. one for calcium ions
Nerve signal reaches muscle, triggers release of chemical signal called neurotransmitter,
that diﬀuses across cell membrane (sarcolimic reticulum) and binds to receptors in it.
Receptor is acetylcholine, ACH. When there is enough nerve signal, the message travels
through t-line to sarcoplasmic reticulum to release calcium ions.
Lacking calcium, tropomyosin site blocked. In calcium, myosin binding sites exposed and
heads bind to actin molecules, delivering force to move ﬁbers in relation to each other.
Myocin head then interacts with ATP to get “recocked”, if myosin still exposed then it
ﬁres again and results in further muscle contration. If there is no further nerve signal,
sarcoplasmic reticulum sequesters Ca+ ions again and no recocking occurs.
Quirari (or curare): known from movies, used in South America, blocks acetylcholine
receptors in cell and causes skeletal paralysis. Victim dies of asphyxiation because he can’t
breathe.
Duchenne's muscular dystrophy: degeneration of sarcolema, plasma membrane of
muscle cell unable to release signal and quickly atrophies.
Fast and slow twitch ﬁbers: vertebrate muscle ﬁber. Terms relative within one group
of animals. Diﬀerences related to diﬀerences in enervation, type of myocin, and actin
activation.
Two parts of force generated by muscle: 1. active component 2. elastic component (energy
stored in muscle when stretched by gravity or another force. Stored in muscle elastic tissue
around tendons. Especially important in limb oscillation, like running, or trunk twisting,
like ﬁsh swimming. Up to 90% of stored elastic energy can be recovered.)
144Subphylum Vertebrata
How does a muscle match its power to its job? Two ways:
1. rate modulation, derived from frequency of nervous stimulation of muscle, force
increases as frequency of stimulation increases up to point of tetanus.
2. selective involvement of motor units, a given neuron enervates a ﬁxed number of
muscle cells, (a motor unit), and force is increased by recruiting more motor units. Motor
units may be small, such as in eye, or larger, like in leg muscle.
How do muscles grow stronger?
1. add more myoﬁlaments, increases cross sectional area by up to 50%, more little ratchets
working
2. proliferation in blood vessels and connective tissue around muscle
Muscle strength is relative to cross sectional area, not length. Not always feasible to add
more cross sectional area.
Pinnate ﬁbers: oriented obliquely (Y-shaped) to minimize muscle mass, in certain circum-
stances, like calf muscle. Spreads muscle out.
Velocity of shortening greater in long muscle than short. Why? Contraction tied to relation
between ﬁbers, and to total length of muscle. Both long and short muscles reach same
percentage of contraction in same unit time, but distance covered by the longer muscle is
greater.
Synergist muscles: muscles work together to produce motion in same general direction.
Bicep shares work with brachialis.
Antagonist muscles: muscles that oppose each other. Bicep pulls forearm in, triceps pulls
it back out.
Origin vs. insertion: origin is the end of the muscle that more ﬁxed in its attachment to
the body. The more movable end called insertion.
Fixators: muscles that act to stabilize a joint or lever system. Like upper arm when you
clench your ﬁst hard.
Flexors and extensors: applied mainly to limbs. Flexor bends one part relative to another
about limb, extensor straightens it.
Adductor and abductor: adductor draws a limb toward the ventral surface. Abductor
moves limb away from ventral surface. (Adduct: drawn toward; abduct: carry away).
14529 Vertebrate digestive system
Functions to break down food into molecules small enough to absorb, or pass across digestive
membrane.
Digestive tract: tube extending from lips of mouth to anus or cloacae in bird, reptile or
monotreme.
Lumanal glands: empty into inner body cavity (lumen: inner surface).
Tract divided into three main regions: 1. buccal cavity 2. pharynx 3. alimentary canal
Alimentary canal divided into four regions: 1. esophagus 2. stomach 3. small intestine 4.
large intestine
Accessory digestive glands, outside digestive tract proper, secrete into lumen of tract
through ducts. Includes the salivary glands, liver and pancreas.
Buccalcavity, whichincludespalateandtongue, developsfrominfoldingofstomadeum,
or second opening of blastula, whereas the rest of the digestive tract develops from the
primitive gut.
Teeth: capture and hold prey. In mammals in particular further process and break down
food into small particles, increasing surface area available for enzymatic action.
Tooth anatomy: 1. crown projects above gum, 2. root below gum, 3. enamel is outer
coating of crown, hardest surface in body, of epideral origin 4. dentin, below enamel,
bone-like and forms bulk of tooth, is harder than bone and contains nerves and blood vessels.
(Remember that mammals are heterodontic, with diﬀerent types of teeth).
Pharynx: air passage for adult, gill slits in embryo. Important in lower vertebrates, site of
gills. Features derived from pharyngeal region: ﬁrst pharyngeal pouch gives rise to parts
of the ear, other pouches give rise to various other structures.
Alimentary canal: epithelium lines lumen, glands secrete into lumen, longitudinal and
circular muscles help digestive movements (peristalsis).
Esophagus: tube carries food from mouth to stomach. Expands to ﬁt large bolus (lump
of chewed food). Secretes mucus for lubrication. Birds have crop for storage, enlargement
of esophagus.
Epiglottis: keeps food out of air tube, an evolutionary “kludge,” or ﬁx.
Stomach. Absorbs water, alcohol, nutrients, uses gastric juice with enzymes, mucous, HCl,
released by chief and parietal cells (release protein enzymes) in gastric pits. Rugae: folds
of stomach, disappear when full. Sphincter at both ends of stomach, control food passage.
Chyme: semi-digested food released to small intestine.
147Vertebrate digestive system
Small intestine: three regions, duodenum, jejunum, and ileum.
Duodenum site of most intestinal digestion. Jejunum and ileum do most of intestinal
absorption. Ileum ends with another sphincter, ileocolic valve or ileosecal valve. Structure:
Circular folds covered with villi (singular is villus).
Villi: ﬁnger-likecellular projections, covered withmicrovilli, tinyprojectionswhichincrease
surfacearea. Increasessurfaceareaby900x, speedsdigestion(breakdown)andabsorption
(taking in nutrients).
Large intestine: larger diameter, shorter length than small intestine. No villi. In mammals,
forms large gentle loop, colon, empties into straight region, rectum, empties into outside
world through anal sphincter. Colon: absorbs water left over, also absorbs vitamins released
by bacteria which live there (vitamin K).
Food: made up of 1. proteins, 2. fats, 3. carbohydrates 4. ﬁbrous material.
Digestive system breaks foods down. Proteins must be broken to amino acids to be
absorbed. Polysaccharides to monosaccharides, lipids to fatty acids and monoglyc-
erides to absorb.
Salivary glands in mouth, saliva contains mucous, salt and a few enzymes (amalase, begins
starch breakdown). Snake venom from oral gland, mixture of toxins and digestive enzymes.
Breaks down blood vessels and disables nervous system.
Stomach enzymes: released in inactive form, zymogene, converts to active form in lumen
of gut. Transformation is triggered by another enzyme, or the stomach’s low pH. Pepsin
secreted as pepsinogen (-ogen means primitive form). Stomach glands secrete up to two or
three liters a day of gastric juice, which is reabsorbed.
Chyme released to duodenum.
Small intestine has two major accessory glands: 1. pancreas 2. liver
Pancreas has endocrine and exocrine functions, releases large amounts of carbonate to
neutralize acidic chyme, as intestinal enzymes work in neutral pH, and stuﬀ to break down
lipids and starch (zymogens, like tripsin)
Liver releases bile. Bile made from cholesterol, stored in gall bladder, released in
duodenum, emulsiﬁes fats.
Emulsify: keeps fats in tiny drops, which are suspended, increasing surface area and action
of lipases. Protein and carbohydrates absorbed in intestine, taken to liver for processing.
Fatty acids go to lymphatic system
Appendix: vestigial remnant. Much variation in digestive systems within mammals:
herbivore, carnivore, insectivore, non-ruminant herbivore.
Rumen: four-chambered stomach of animals like cows (ruminant herbivores). Cellulose
resistant to digestion, rely on microorganisms to break down cellulose. Some bacteria,
protists and fungi can break down cellulose, almost no animals can. Bacteria break down
cellulose in rumen, to be taken back to the mouth to chew their cud (ruminate). Later cow
swallows to proceed with digestion. (Horses not like this).
148Subphylum Vertebrata
Coprophagy: rabbits and other animals eat their own feces for the nutritious products of
the cecum.
14930 Circulatory system
Circulatory system functions
1. Transportation
a. Respiration: gas exchange (O2 and CO2), overcomes limited rate
of
diﬀusion
b. Nutrition:<br>
c. Excretory: (remove metabolic wastes)<br>
2. Regulation
a. Transport hormones<br>
b. Regulate body temperature<br>
c. Protection<br>
i. Blood clotting<br>
ii. Immune system (carries white blood cells)
Vasodilation: allows heat loss across epidermis, as seen in elephant ears, takes more blood
to surface of body, sweating may accompany
Countercurrent heat exchange: used by dolphins in ﬁns to conserve heat in cold water.
Veins surround an artery, and blood returning to body absorbs heat from blood traveling
out from body to ﬁn, minimizing heat loss. Used by dogs in feet, etc.
Blood made of 1. plasma and 2. formed cellular elements (red and white blood cells,
and platelets).
Plasma makes up 55% of blood volume. Cellular elements make up the other 45%.
Plasma makeup: 90% water, 7-8% soluble proteins (albumin maintains blood osmotic
integrity, others clot, etc.) 1% electrolytes 1% elements in transit
Red blood cell (erythrocyte): contains hemoglobin, functions in oxygen transport. In
mammals, red blood cells lose nuclei on maturation, and take on biconcave, dimpled, shape.
No self repair, live 120 days. About 1000x more red blood cells than white blood cells.
About 7-8 micrometers in diameter.
151Circulatory system
Hematocrit: proportion of blood volume that is occupied by cells, about 43% in humans
on average. 48% for men and 38% for women.
White blood cells (leukocytes): Nucleated, about 10-14 micrometers in diameter, com-
monly amoeboid, escape circulatory system in capillary beds. Include basophils, eosinophils,
neutrophils, monocytes, B- and T-cell lymphocytes.
Platelets (thrombocytes) Membrane bound cell fragments in mammals, no nucleus. In
non-mammals, platelet role replaced by nucleated cells. Accumulate at site of broken blood
vessels, form clots. Bud oﬀ special cells in bone marrow. 1-2 micrometers in diameter. 7-8
day life span, 1/10 or 1/20 as abundant as white blood cells.
Arteries: carry blood away from heart. Smallest tubes called arterioles, feed blood to
capillaries.
Veins: return blood to heart. Smallest veins called venules.
Structure of arteries and veins, listed from inside (lumen) out: 1. epithelium (endothelium),
2. elastic connective tissue ﬁbers, 3. smooth muscle, 4. connective tissue. Arteries
have thicker elastic layer than do veins.
Capillaries, where exchange of materials occurs, are very thin and narrow, and red blood
cells pass through single ﬁle. Capillaries are tiny but numerous, and their total volume is
greater than that of supplying arteries.
Blood velocity drops in capillaries, picks back up in veins. Pressure highest in arteries, lower
in capillaries and arteries.
Osmotic pressure draws interstitial ﬂuid from blood in arterioles, but replaces it in venules.
One-way valves mean that blood can ﬂow only one way, works with residual blood pressure
and compression by skeletal muscles. Low pressure in thoracic cavity caused by breathing
also helps move blood.
Lymphatic system: part of the immune system, a one-way, or open, system. Takes up
interstitial ﬂuid not taken up by venules.
Lymphatic structures:
1. lymphatic capillaries
2. lymphatic vesicles
3. lymph nodes
4. lymphatic organs (spleen and thymus)
Lymph: movement in mammals through one-way valves, similar to blood movement in
veins. (Some non-mammals have lymphatic hearts of unknown embryonic origin. Frogs and
salamanders have several.) Lymph rejoins cardiovascular system into a large vein near the
heart via single large thoracic duct.
152Subphylum Vertebrata
As lymph passes through system, passes lymphocytes, second part of immune system.
Heart: pumps blood, design varies between animals. In adult mammal,four chambers form
two separate circulations
1. pulmonary circulation to and from lungs and
2. systemic circulation to and from tissues of body.
Everything in the heart comes in pairs: 2 atria, 2 ventricles (left and right).
Diagrams usually drawn as though animal were on its back.
Pattern of blood ﬂow through heart: blood returning from major veins (vena cava)
enters rightatrium, contraction there delivers blood to rightventricle through atricuspid
valve, one of atrial ventricular valves (AV valve). Contraction of right ventricle drives blood
through semi lunar valve into pulmonary circuit and to lungs.Blood return to heart in
pulmonary veins, is oxygenated. Goes to left atrium, which contracts and delivers blood
to left ventricleby way of aortic semi-lunar valve, then goes to systemic circulation.
Both atria and ventricles contract in unison, left is more powerful than right (to all system
vs. just lungs).
Systole: heart contraction, diastole: heart relaxed
Timing of heart contraction: ventricles rebound to relaxed shape (diastole), and semi-
lunar valves close. Both atria(singular: atrium) ﬁll with blood coming from pulmonary
and systemic circulations.Pressure rises in the atria and blood begins to move into the
ventricles.The atria then contract, forcing more blood into the ventricles. There is a pause,
then ventricles contract. This raises ventricle pressure, atrio-ventricular(AV) valves
shut and semi-lunar valves open, forcing blood from the left ventricle into the major arteries
and from the right ventricle into the aorta.
Control for this action doesn’t rely on nervous stimulation, has intrinsic rhythmicity, called
myogenic. This is the case in mammal as well as in mollusk hearts. Other animals have
neurogenic hearts that rely on nervous stimulation for heart action, originating in the
cardiac ganglion.
The rhythmicity of mammalian heart relies on the sino-atrial (SA)node, or pacemaker.
This is a phylogenic (based on evolutionary history) remnant of an early vertebrate heart
that had one more chamber than modern hearts.
How the heart contracts: waves of depolarization start in SA node and spread
through atria. Connectile tissue pauses the spread of depolarization at the atrial ventricular
node. Signal continued by bundle branches to lower ventricle, begins to stimulate
heart to contract. Contraction starts at bottom of heart at heart apex,then signals spread
through heart.
Medulla (in the brain) controls autonomic nervous system. (The medulla is part of
the brain, is continuous with the spinal cord, and controls involuntary actions of the
body). Sympatheticcardiacacceleratorconnectstospinalcord, usesnorepinephrine
to signal. Parasympathetic cardio-inhibitory center reaches heart through Vagus
153Circulatory system
nerve, usesacetylcholine to signal. Hyperpolarizes membrane to inhibit heart contraction.
(Autonomic nervous system: two parts working in contra to control from both sides.)
Dominant eﬀect here is inhibitory. If we cut Vagus nerve, heart rate promptly rises about
25 bpm.
15431 Respiratory system
In humans and other animals, for example, the anatomical features of the respiratory system
include airways, lungs, and the respiratory muscles.
Other animals, such as insects, have respiratory systems with very simple anatomical features,
and in amphibians even the skin plays a vital role in gas exchange.
Plants also have respiratory systems but the directionality of gas exchange can be opposite
to that in animals. The respiratory system in plants also includes anatomical features such
as holes on the undersides of leaves known as stomata.
In mammals, the diaphragm divides the body cavity into the
abdominal cavity: contains the viscera (e.g., stomach and intestines)
thoracic cavity: contains the heart and lungs.
Respiratory tree: terminates in alveolus, alveoli. Respiratory bronchioles branch into
alveolar ducts and into alveoli. Alveolus: microscopic air sacs, 300 million of these in human
lungs. Total surface area large. Gas diﬀuses micrometer, very tiny distance.
Nervous System
Composed of tissues designed to integrate sensory information and direct a coordinated
response to the environment.
1
Basic unit of the nervous system is the neuron , a highly specialized cell that uses both
electrical and chemical processes to communicate. Neurons "listen" to sensory organs or
other neurons, and can simultaneously "hear" from 1 to hundreds of inputs simultaneously.
Likewise, a neuron can "talk" to other neurons or cells that can create an action, like muscle
cells or glands.
Neurons are outnumbered in the nervous system by glia. Glia were once thought to only play
a supportive role in helping neurons survive; today we know that they also are important
participants in the communication process. Glial cells include astrocytes, ependymal cells,
and a cell that has a macrophage like function. There are also oligodendocytes and Schwann
cells that provide a myelin sheath.

31.1 Neuron structure
Figure 9 Neuron
• Dendrite will receive information from other axons
• Stoma is the neuron body and contains typical cell parts including the mitochondria and
nucleus. This is where neurotransmitters are synthesized.
• Axon hillock is where the cell body and the axon meet.
• Axon is surrounded by myelin.
• Contains nodes of Ranvier
Types of axons include unipolar, bipolar, pseudopolar.
Action potentials results from excitatory stimuli received from the dendrites that results
in a signal that travels down the axon. On the cellular level, there is a Na+ inﬂux via
channels causing a depolarization of the cell. Once those channels close, the slower opening
K+ channels will open resulting in hyperpolarization by the cell.
Synapses
Neurotransmitters allow a chemical signal to be sent from one neuron to the other. Neuro-
transmitters must bypass a physical gap called the synapse. Examples of neurotransmitters
include acetylcholine, epinephrine, and glutamate.
Example : Neuromuscular synapses
156Central nervous system
Circuits / Nuclei / Ganglia
31.2 Central nervous system
Central nervous system includes the brain and the spinal cord.
Brain There are four lobes of the brain.
• Frontal lobe - decision making
• Parietal lobe
• Temporal lobe
• Occipital lobe - vision
The areas of the brain are also dedicated to diﬀerent functions.
• Precentral gyrus
• Postcentral gyrus
Protection The CNS is protected by three layers - the pia mater, the arachnoid mater, and
the dura mater. Protection also comes from the circulation of cerebral spinal ﬂuid (CSF).
CSF helps to ﬂoat the brain and also provide nutrients to both the brain and the spinal
cord. CSF is synthesized from the choroid plexus of the lateral ventricles. In total, there are
four ventricles - 2 lateral ventricles, a 3rd, and 4th ventricle.
31.3 Peripheral nervous system
The peripheral nervous system is broken down into two sub-systems, the somatic nervous
system and the autonomic nervous system.
ANS - Autonomic Nervous System The ANS has two components - parasympathetic and
sympathetic.
The sympathetic nervous system is the "ﬁght or ﬂight" or fright response and results in an
increased heart rate, increased rate of breathing, and an elevated blood glucose level. There
is also decreased digestion. The second neurotransmitter is epinephrine. In this case, the
ﬁrst neuron is short and the second neuron is long.
The parasympathetic nervous system is the rest and digest system.
Drugs must be able to pass the blood brain barrier to have an eﬀect on the CNS. Drugs act
by aﬀecting the neuron and how likely it is to ﬁre an action potential.
Stroke occurs when there is a blood clot that goes to the brain and prevent blood ﬂow.
15732 Sensory systems
Categorized by
1. nature of stimulus, such as mechanical, chemicalor light stimulus, and
2. where stimulus received, such as outside (exteroceptors,such as the eye and
skin temp receptors) or insidebody (interoceptors, such as blood body tem-
perature receptors).
Transduction of sensory input into signal. Means to “carry across”,signal transduced, or
carried, from environment into nervous signal.
Three sensory processes we cover
1. taste and smell (chemoreception)
2. gravity and movement
3. light
32.1 Taste and smell (chemoreception)
Found in mammal nose and mouth, ﬂy feet, ﬁsh bodies, moth antennae.
Papilla: bumps on tongue, contain taste buds down between. Sweet, sour, salty and bitter.
Some act directly by ion channels, others act indirectly. Other “taste” sensations really
smell.
Smell: received in nasopharynx. Airborne molecules go into solution on moist epithelial
surface of nasal passage. Approximately 1000 genescode for sensory neuron receptors. “Fried
onions” odor not one receptor but a mixture of many odors registered in our mind as one.
Very sensitive, habituates rapidly (don’t notice a smell after a bit). Odor sensation has
relatively unﬁltered root to higher brain centers.
Snakes more chemosensory focused than us.
32.2 Response to gravity and movement
Registered in inner ear. Three semicircular canals loop in three planes at right angles
to each other, responsible for transduction of movement messages. Method: hair cells
159Sensory systems
deformed by gelatinous membrane. Vestibular apparatus, gives us perception of gravity
and movement. Due to physical response, not chemical binding.
Cochlea: bony, coil shaped part of inner ear, where hearing occurs.
Sound enters throughauditory canal, vibratestympanic membrane,moving three bones
of middle ear (malleus, incus, and stapes)against oval window opening in front of cochlea.
Cochlea has three ﬂuid ﬁlled ducts, one of these the organ of Corti. Sound waves in air
go to vibration in organ of Corti; ﬂuid tickles hair cells, which register the movement
along basilar membrane in cochlea. Diﬀerent sound frequencies move diﬀerent portions
of basilar membrane. Hearing loss due to loss of hair cells.Humans normally smell more
than 300 odors in a day(Facts and Truth).
Transduction of sound accomplished throgh physical deformation,not chemical binding.
32.3 Vision
Light enters pupil, focused by lensonto retina.
Sclera: hardened part behind retina.
Optic nerves and neurons attached to retina. Blind spot where optic nerve attaches, has
no receptors.
Two types of photoreceptors
1. rods - black and white low-light vision, 100 million in each retina in humans.
2. cones - color vision, work best under better illumination. 3 million in each retina.
Fovia: region of most acute vision, has most of the cones, few rods.
Transduction process of light to signal a molecular change, to light absorbing molecule
called photopigment. Located in outer parts of rods and cones in pigment discs. The rod
photopigment is called rhodopsin,cone has three photopigments, called photopsins. This
molecular change initiates pathways to result in action potential in downstream neuron
leading to vision center in brain.Parul Godika
Each of the three photopsins has a diﬀerent peak of sensitivity: blue,green or red, and
changes isometric form (from cisto trans) based on light from a particular wavelength
range. Color blindness:inherited lack of one or more types of these cones. Gene carried on X
chromosome, therefore more common in men than women.
32.4 Homeostasis
Is a very important part of everyone's and everything's lives. Deﬁned as dynamic con-
stancy of internal environment, maintenance of a relatively stable environment inside
an organism usually involving feedback regulation.
160Osmotic environments and regulations
Homeostasis is maintained in face of
1. a varying external environment, or
2. a non-ideal, constant external environment (as with the penguin).
Deals with temperature, pH, chemical concentrations,pressure, oxygen levels.
Occurs through negative feedback loops.
Various forms: simple thermostat in house turns oﬀ heater when above a certain temperature
and on when below a certain temperature Involves stimulus, sensor,integrating center,
eﬀector and response.
More eﬃcient control has two sensors and two eﬀectors. Can be antagonistic to each
other, such as, one cools, the other heats.
Precise control through proportional control, not all-or-none, furnace comes on a little
bit if the house a bit cold. Examples in humans: vasoconstriction, change in metabolic rate,
shivering. Physiological responses for high body temp: blood goes to body surface, sweating,
behavioral changes (get out of sun).
Positive feedback loop: eﬀector increases deviation from set point. Ampliﬁes reaction.
Like blood clotting process, uterine contraction during childbirth. Negative feedback must
exist at some point for control.
32.5 Osmotic environments and regulations
1. Marine invertebrates
a) fully marine invertebrates (not intertidal or estuarine) osmoconformers (set
internal environment same as environment, no net ﬂow of ions) in a stenohaline
(narrow non-changing salt level) environment
b) Coastal, intertidal, estuarine (ion levels ﬂuctuate) invertebrates.Partly osmo-
confomers, partly osmoregulators in a euryhaline (wide salt level variation)
environment (ex: shore crab, regulates sometimes when salt levels in environment
get real low).
2. Freshwater animals. Here, environment has lower solute concentrations than do
living organisms so water tends to ﬂow in and solutes out.
a) Freshwater ﬁsh (bony) dilute urine, and gills actively take up ions (NaCl)
b) Freshwater invertebrates: same situation as freshwater ﬁsh but with diﬀerent
structures
c) Freshwater amphibians: active uptake of salts across their skin
3. Marine ﬁshes: Here the environment has a higher solute concentration than does
the organism so water tends to ﬂow out and ions in.
a) Bony ﬁshes: actively secrete salts (NaCl) across gills, absorb water across gut
wall, their kidney (unlike mammalian kidney) is unable to generate concentrated
urine so glomerulus is reduced, active tubular secretion of MgSO
4
b) cartilaginous ﬁshes (and coelacanth): blood retains urea and trimethylamineoxide
to increase its osmolality to that of seawater
161Sensory systems
4. Terrestrial animals: here problem is loss of water to a drier environment, and
regulation of salt levels.
a) water loss adaptations
b) concentrated exception of salts and nitrogenous wastes
Hypoosmotic: having less osmotic potential than nearby ﬂuid
Hyperosmotic: having more osmotic potential than nearby ﬂuid
Isoosmotic: having equal osmotic potential than nearby ﬂuid
Glomerulus: reduces volume of kidney
Fish started in salt water, spread to fresh water, later reinvaded salt-water environment.
Terrestrial animal water sources:
1. drinking
2. moist foods
3. from breakdown of metabolic molecules like fats. (Desert kangaroo rats get 90% of their
water from metabolism.)
Secretion of nitrogenous wastes: from metabolism of amino acids, amino group has to be
removed in one of three basically interchangeable chemical forms:
1. ammonia (aquatic life)
2. urea (mammals)
3. uric acid (birds)
Ammonia very toxic, soluble, and cheap to produce. Easy to expel for bony ﬁshes.
Urea: low toxicity, good solubility, more costly to lose as it contains other groups on it.
Must be released in solution, water cost.
Uric acid (white part of bird poo) low toxicity, insoluble, secreted with little water loss,
more costly side groups lost than the others.
Mammalian kidney: Structure: ﬁst-sized organ in lower back. About 1/5 of blood from
aorta at any time is passing through kidneys. Blood passes through kidney many times a
day.
Nephron: structural and functional unit of kidney.
Bowmans capsule: funnel-like opening, contains primary ﬁlter, the glomerulus.
Proximal convoluted tubule: receives stuﬀ from Bowmans capsule.
Loop of Henle: descends and ascends.
162Osmotic environments and regulations
Vasa recta: capillaries that surround the Loop of Henle.
Glomerulus: main ﬁlter of the nephron, located within the Bowman's capsule
Kidney properties and processes important to its function
1. Active transport of solutes from one ﬂuid to another against a concentration gradient,
+
Na actively transported out of ﬁltrate by cells of the thick ascending loop of Henley into
the interstitial ﬂuid
2. Passive movement of solutes and water from one ﬂuid to another(down a concen-
tration gradient), movement of water and NaCl out of descending loop of Henley into
interstitial ﬂuid.
3. Diﬀerential permeability of cells in diﬀerent regions of the nephron to movement
of water and solutes, ascending thick look is impermeable to water, descending portion is
permeable to water
4. Hormonal control of that permeability, antidiuretic hormone(ADH) increases
permeability of collecting due to water, resulting in reduced volume of ﬁltrate and thus
more concentrated urine.
5. Increasing solute concentration in the interstitial ﬂuid of the kidney, from the
cortex to the deepest medulla, maintained by a countercurrent multiplier mechanism

11 Getting Started
32 Biology - The Life Science
The word biology means, "the science of life", from the Greek bios, life, and logos, word
or knowledge. Therefore, Biology is the science of Living Things. That is why Biology is
sometimes known as Life Science.
1
The science has been divided into many subdisciplines, such as botany , bacteriology,
2 3
anatomy , zoology, histology, mycology, embryology, parasitology, genetics , molecular biol-
4 5 6 7
ogy , systematics, immunology, microbiology , physiology, cell biology , cytology, ecology ,
and virology. Other branches of science include or are comprised in part of biology studies,
8
including paleontology , taxonomy, evolution, phycology, helimentology, protozoology, en-
tomology, biochemistry, biophysics, biomathematics, bio engineering, bio climatology and
anthropology.
2.1 Characteristics of life
Not all scientists agree on the deﬁnition of just what makes up life. Various characteristics
describe most living things. However, with most of the characteristics listed below we can
think of one or more examples that would seem to break the rule, with something nonliving
being classiﬁed as living or something living classiﬁed as nonliving. Therefore we are careful
not to be too dogmatic in our attempt to explain which things are living or nonliving.
• Living things are composed of matter structured in an orderly way where simple
molecules are ordered together into much larger macromolecules.
An easy way to remember this is GRIMNERD C All organisms; - Grow, Respire, Interact,
Move, Need Nutrients, Excrete (Waste), Reproduce,Death, Cells (Made of)
• Living things are sensitive, meaning they are able to respond to stimuli.
• Living things are able to grow, develop, and reproduce.
• Living things are able to adapt over time by the process of natural selection.
9
• All known living things use the hereditary molecule, DNA .

5Biology - The Life Science
• Internal functions are coordinated and regulated so that the internal environment of a
10
living thing is relatively constant, referred to as homeostasis .
11
Living things are organized in the microscopic level from atoms up to cells . Atoms are
12 13
arranged into molecules, then into macromolecules , which make up organelles , which
work together to form cells. Beyond this, cells are organized in higher levels to form entire
14
multicellular organisms. Cells together form tissues , which make up organs, which are
part of organ systems, which work together to form an entire organism. Of course, beyond
this, organisms form populations which make up parts of an ecosystem. All of the Earth's
ecosystems together form the diverse environment that is the earth.
Example:-
sub atoms, atoms, molecules, cells, tissues, organs, organ systems, organisms, population,
community, eco systems
2.2 Nature of science
Science is a methodology for learning about the world. It involves the application
of knowledge.
The scientiﬁc method deals with systematic investigation, reproducible results, the
formation and testing of hypotheses, and reasoning.
Reasoning can be broken down into two categories, induction (speciﬁc data is used to
develop a generalized observation or conclusion) and deduction (general information leads
to speciﬁc conclusion). Most reasoning in science is done through induction.
Science as we now know it arose as a discipline in the 17th century.
2.3 Scientiﬁc method
The scientiﬁc method is not a step by step, linear process. It is an intuitive process, a
methodology for learning about the world through the application of knowledge. Scientists
must be able to have an "imaginative preconception" of what the truth is. Scientists will
often observe and then hypothesize the reason why a phenomenon occurred. They use all
of their knowledge and a bit of imagination, all in an attempt to uncover something that
might be true. A typical scientiﬁc investigation might go like so:
You observe that a room appears dark, and you ponder why the room is dark. In an attempt
to ﬁnd explanations to this curiosity, your mind unravels several diﬀerent hypotheses. One
hypothesis might state that the lights are turned oﬀ. Another hunch might be that the
room's lightbulb has burnt out. Worst yet, you could be going blind. To discover the truth,

12 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/macromolecule
13 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/organelle
14 http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/General%20Biology%2FTissues
6Scientiﬁc method
you experiment. You feel your way around the room and ﬁnd a light switch and turn it on.
No light. You repeat the experiment, ﬂicking the switch back and forth. Still nothing. That
means your initial hypothesis, the room is dark because the lights are oﬀ, has been rejected.
You devise more experiments to test your hypotheses, utilizing a ﬂashlight to prove that
you are indeed not blind. In order to accept your last remaining hypothesis as the truth,
you could predict that changing the light bulb will ﬁx the problem. If all your predictions
succeed, the original hypothesis is valid and is accepted. In some cases, however, your
predictions will not occur, in which you'll have to start over. Perhaps the power is oﬀ.
Figure 1 How Science is Done
A diagram that illustrates scientiﬁc investigation
Scientists ﬁrst make observations that raise a particular question. In order to explain the
observed phenomenon, they develop a number of possible explanations, or hypotheses. This
is the inductive part of science, observing and constructing plausible arguments for why
7Biology - The Life Science
an event occurred. Experiments are then used to eliminate one of more of the possible
hypotheses until one hypothesis remains. Using deduction, scientists use the principles of
their hypothesis to make predictions, and then test to make sure that their predictions are
conﬁrmed. After many trials (repeatability) and all predictions have been conﬁrmed, the
hypothesis then may become a theory.
Quick Deﬁnitions
Observation - Quantitative and qualitative measurements of the world.
Inference - Deriving new knowledge based upon old knowledge.
Hypotheses - A suggested explanation.
Rejected Hypothesis - An explanation that has been ruled out through experimentation.
Accepted Hypothesis - An explanation that has not been ruled out through excessive
experimentation and makes veriﬁable predictions that are true.
Experiment - A test that is used to rule out a hypothesis or validate something already
known.
Scientiﬁc Method - The process of scientiﬁc investigation.
Theory - A widely accepted hypothesis that stands the test of time. Often tested, and
usually never rejected.
The scientiﬁc method is based primarily on the testing of hypotheses by experimentation.
This involves acontrol, or subject that does not undergo the process in question. A scientist
will also seek to limit variables to one or another very small number, single or minimum
number of variables. The procedure is to form a hypothesis or prediction about what you
believe or expect to see and then do everything you can to violate that, or falsify the
hypotheses. Although this may seem unintuitive, the process serves to establish more ﬁrmly
what is and what is not true.
A founding principle in science is a lack of absolute truth: the accepted explanation is the
most likely and is the basis for further hypotheses as well as for falsiﬁcation. All knowledge
has its relative uncertainty.
Theories are hypotheses which have withstood repeated attempts at falsiﬁcation. Common
theories include evolution by natural selection and the idea that all organisms consist of
cells. The scientiﬁc community asserts that much more evidence supports these two ideas
than contradicts them.
8Charles Darwin
2.4 Charles Darwin
Figure 2
Charles Darwin is most remembered today for his contribution of the theory of evolution
through natural selection.
The seeds of this theory were planted in Darwin's mind through observations made on a
ﬁve-year voyage through the New World on a ship called the Beagle. There, he studied
fossils and the geological record, geographic distribution of organisms, the uniqueness and
relatedness of island life forms, and the aﬃnity of island forms to mainland forms.
Upon his return to England, Darwin pondered over his observations and concluded that
evolution must occur through natural selection. He declined, however, to publish his work
because of its controversial nature. However, when another scientist, Wallace, reached similar
conclusions, Darwin was convinced to publish his observations in 1859. His hypothesis
revolutionized biology and has yet to be falsiﬁed by empirical data collected by mainstream
scientists.
2.5 After Darwin
Since Darwin's day, scientists have amassed a more complete fossil record, including
microorganisms and chemical fossils. These fossils have supported and added subtleties
to Darwin's theories. However, the age of the Earth is now held to be much older than
Darwin thought. Researchers have also uncovered some of the preliminary mysteries of
the mechanism of heredity as carried out through genetics and DNA, areas unknown to
Darwin. Another growing area is comparative anatomy including homology and analogy.
Today we can see a bit of evolutionary history in the development of embryos, as certain
(although not all) aspects of development recapitulate evolutionary history.
9Biology - The Life Science
15
The molecular biology study of slowly mutating genes reveal considerable evolutionary
history consistent with fossil and anatomical record.
2.6 Challenges to Darwin
Figure 3
Darwin and his theories have been challenged many times in the last 150 years. The
challenges have been primarily religious based on a perceived conﬂict with the preconceived
notion of creationism. Many of those who challenge Darwin have been adherents to the
young earth hypothesis that says that the Earth is only some 6000 years old and that all
species were individually created by a god. Some of the proponents of these theories have
suggested that chemical and physical laws that exist today were diﬀerent or nonexistent in
earlier ages. However, for the most part, these theories are either not scientiﬁcally testable
and fall outside the area of attention of the ﬁeld of biology, or have been disproved by one
or more ﬁelds of science.

together are called peptide bonds. One of these bonds makes a monopeptide, two a dipeptide,
and any more than that makes a polypeptide.

185 Life: History and Origin
5.1 Properties of life
1. Organization: Being structurally composed of one or more cells, which are the basic
units of life.
• prokaryote: no nucleus
• eukaryote: membrane bound nucleus.
2. Sensitivity: respond to stimuli.
3. Energy Processing
4. Growth and Development
5. Reproduction
• hereditary mechanisms to make more of self; DNA based.
6. Regulation, including homeostasis.
7. Evolution.
5.2 Origin of life: 3 hypotheses
• Extraterrestrial origin (panspermia): meteor, comet borne from elsewhere in universe
• evidence of amino acids and other organic material in space (but often both D & L
forms)
• questionable bacterial fossils in Martian rock
-However, this would imply that some other origin of life was likely because it would have
had to happen elsewhere before it could be transported here, and the only diﬀerence would
be that life did not originate on Earth.
• Spontaneous origin on earth: primitive self-replicating macromolecules acted upon by
natural selection ((macro)Evolution is one example of this)
-This is often attacked for the seeming impossibility for life to have been produced by a
chemical reaction triggered by lightning and the ability of any produced DNA to actually be
in a sequence that could produce a working model of life if replicated. It is also attacked
for religious reasons, as it bypasses things like the idea of a supreme being directly creating
humans. It also seems unlikely to some that such huge changes are possible in evolution
19Life: History and Origin
without evidence of an "in-between stage" that is credible. Many of the stages of man are
disputed due to their somewhat shakey grounds. For example, bones from other animals
have been taken accidentally in some cases to be part of a humanoid, and complete skeletons
have been sketched out from a limited number of bones.
• Special creation: religious explanations (Intelligent Design is one popular example of
this.) These explanations contend that life was created by God (or perhaps some other
Intelligent Designer).
• Proponents of Intelligent design suggest that the vast complexity of life could only
have been intentionally designed while other creationists cite biblical support.
-This is often attacked for many of the same reasons that religion is attacked, and is often
regarded as superstitious and/or unscientiﬁc.
• It is debated as to whether schools should teach one hypothesis or the other when talking
about the origin of life. However, since they are all currently known major hypotheses
(and sometimes hypotheses proven wrong are shown for educational purposes), this
wikibook includes what it can without discriminating unfairly against one hypothesis or
the other.
5.3 The early earth
It is believed that the Earth was formed about 4.5 billion years ago.
• Heavy bombardment by rubble ceased about 3.8 billion years ago.
• Reducing atmosphere: much free H
• also H O, NH , CH
2 3 4
• little, if any, free O
2
• with numerous H electrons, require little energy to form organic compounds with C
• Warm oceans, estimated at 49-88°C
• Lack of O and consequent ozone (O ) meant considerable UV energy
2 3
Chemical reactions on early earth
• UV and other energy sources would promote chemical reactions and formation of organic
molecules
• Testable hypothesis: Miller-Urey experiment
• simulated early atmospheric conditions
• found amino acids, sugars, etc., building blocks of life
• won Nobel prize for work
• experiment showed prebiotic synthesis of biological molecules was possible
Issues
• Miller later conceded that the conditions in his experiments were not representative of
what is currently thought to be those of early earth
• He also conceded that science has no answer for how amino acids could self-organize into
replicating molecules and cells
• In the 50 years since Miller-Urey, signiﬁcant issues and problems for biogenesis have been
identiﬁed. This is a weak hypothesis at this time.
20Origin of cells
• Conclusion: Life exists, we don't know why.
5.4 Origin of cells
Cells are very small and decompose quickly after death. As such, fossils of the earliest cells
do not exist. Scientists have had to form a variety of theories on how cells (and hence life)
was created on Earth.
• Bubble hypothesis
• A. Oparin, J.B.S. Haldane, 1930’s
• Primary abiogenesis: life as consequence of geochemical processes
• Protobionts: isolated collections of organic material enclosed in hydrophobic bubbles
• Numerous variants: microspheres, protocells, protobionts, micelles, liposomes, coacer-
vates
• Other surfaces for evolution of life
• deep sea thermal vents
• ice crystals
• clay surfaces
• tidal pools
5.5 The RNA world?
• DNA→ RNA→ polypeptide (protein)
• Catalytic RNA: ribozyme
• discovered independently by Tom Cech and Sid Altman (Nobel prize)
• catalytic properties: hydrolysis, polymerization, peptide bond formation, etc.
• Self-replicating RNA molecule may have given rise to life
• consistent with numerous roles for RNA in cells as well as roles for ribonucleotides
(ATP)
• relationship to bubble-like structures is uncertain
5.6 The earliest cells
• Microfossils
• ˜3.5 by
• resemble bacteria: prokaryotes
• biochemical residues
• stromatolites
• Archaebacteria (more properly Archaea)
• extremophiles: salt, acid, alkali, heat, methanogens
• may not represent most ancient life
• Eubacteria
• cyanobacteria: photosynthesis
• atmospheric O ; limestone deposits
2
21Life: History and Origin
• chloroplasts of eukaryotes
Cyanobacteria
5.7 Major steps in evolution of life
• Prebiotic synthesis of macromolecules
• Self replication
• RNA? (primitive metabolism)
• DNA as hereditary material
• 1st cells
• Photosynthesis
• Aerobic respiration
• Multicellularity (more than once)

226 Cells
237 Cell structure
7.1 What is a cell?
The word cell comes from the Latin word "cella", meaning "small room", and it was ﬁrst
coined by a microscopist observing the structure of cork. The cell is the basic unit of all
living things, and all organisms are composed of one or more cells. Cells are so basic and
critical to the study of life, in fact, that they are often referred to as "the building blocks of
life". Organisms - bacteria, amoebae and yeasts, for example - may consist of as few as one
cell, while a typical human body contains about a trillion cells.
According to Cell Theory, ﬁrst proposed by Schleiden and Schwann in 1839, all life consists
of cells. The theory also states that all cells come from previously living cells, all vital
functions (chemical reactions) of organisms are carried out inside of cells, and that cells
contain necessary hereditary information to carry out necessary functions and replicate
themselves.
All cells contain:
1
• Lipid bilayer boundary (plasma membrane )
2
• Cytoplasm
3
• DNA (hereditary information)
4
• Ribosomes for protein synthesis
Eukaryotic cells also contain:
5
• At least one nucleus
6
• Mitochondria for cell respiration and energy
Cells may also contain:
7
• Lysosomes
8
• Peroxisomes
9
• Vacuoles
10
• Cell walls

25Cell structure
7.1.1 Concepts
Plasma Membrane
Phospholipid bilayer, which contains great amount of proteins, the most important functions
are the following:
1. It selectively isolates the content of the cell of the external atmosphere.
2. It regulates the interchange of substances between the cytoplasm and the environment.
3. Communicates with other cells.
Model of the ﬂuid mosaic
Describes the structure of the plasma membrane, this model was developed in 1972 by
cellular biologists J. Singer and L. Nicholson.
Phospholipid bilayer
Is in the plasma membrane and produces the ﬂuid part of membranes.
Proteins
Long chains of amino acids.
Glucose proteins
Proteins together with carbohydrates in the plasma membrane, mostly in the outer parts
of the cell.
Functions of proteins
Transport oxygen, they are components of hair and nails, and allow the cell interact with
its environment.
Transport Proteins
Regulate the movement of soluble water molecules, through the plasma membrane. Some
transport proteins called channel proteins form pores or channels in the membrane so
that water soluble molecules pass.
Carrying proteins
Have union sites that can hold speciﬁc molecules.
Reception proteins
They activate cellular responses when speciﬁc molecules join.
Proteins of recognition
They work as identiﬁers and as place of union to the cellular surface.
Fluid
It is any substance that can move or change of form.
Concentration
Number of molecules in a determined unit of volume.
26What is a cell?
Gradient
Physical diﬀerence between two regions of space, in such a way that the molecules tend to
move in response to the gradients.
Diﬀusion
Movement of the molecules in a ﬂuid, from the regions of high concentration to those of
low concentration.
Passive transport
Movement of substances in a membrane that doesn’t need to use energy.
Simple diﬀusion
Diﬀusion of water, gases or molecules across the membrane.
Facilitated diﬀusion
Diﬀusion of molecules across the membranes with the participation of proteins.
Osmosis
Diﬀusion of the water across a membrane with diﬀerential permeability.
Transport that needs energy
Movement of substances across a membrane generally in opposition to a gradient of
concentration with the requirement of energy.
Active transport
Movement of small molecules using energy (ATP).
Endocytosis
Movement of big particles towards the interior of the cell using energy. The cells enclose
particles or liquids.
Pinocytosis
(Literally cell drinking) Form in which the cell introduces liquids.
Phagocytosis
Way of eating of the cells. It feeds in this case of big particles or entire microorganisms.
Pseudopods
False feet (the amoeba).
Exocitosis
Movement of materials out of the cell with the use of energy. It throws waste material.
Isotonic
The cytoplasm ﬂuid of the interior of the cells is the same that the outer.
Hypertonic solution
27Cell structure
The solutions that have a higher concentration of dissolved particles than the cellular
cytoplasm and that therefore water of the cells goes out with osmosis.
Hypotonic
The solutions with a concentration of dissolved particles lower than the cytoplasm of a cell
and that therefore do that water enters the cell with osmosis.
Swelling
Pressure of the water inside the vacuole.
Endoplasmic Reticulum
It is the place of the synthesis of the cellular membrane.
7.1.2 Structure and function of the cell
Rudolf Virchow
Zoologist, who proposed the postulates of the cellular theory, observes that the living cells
could grow and be in two places at the same time, he proposed that all the cells come from
other equal cells and proposed 3 postulates:
1. Every living organism is formed from one or more cells
2. The smallest organisms are unicellular and these in turn are the functional units of
the multicellular organisms.
3. All the cells come from preexisting cells.
7.1.3 Common characteristics of all the cells
Molecular components
Proteins, amino acids, lipids, sweeten, DNA, RNA.
Structural components
Plasmatic membrane, citoplasm, ribosomes.
Robert Hooke
He postuled for the ﬁrst time the term cell
Prokaryotes
Their genetic material is not enclosed in a membrane ex. Bacterias
Eukaryotes
Their genetic material is contained inside a nucleus closed by a membrane
28History of cell knowledge
7.2 History of cell knowledge
The optical microscope was ﬁrst invented in 17th century. Shortly thereafter scientists began
to examine living and dead biological tissues in order to better understand the science of
life. Some of the most relevant discovery milestones of the time period include:
11
• The invention of the microscope , which allowed scientists for the ﬁrst time to see
biological cells
12
• Robert Hooke in 1665 looked at cork under a microscope and described what he called
cork "cells"
13
• Anton van Leeuwenhoek called the single-celled organisms that he saw under the
microscope "animalcules"
14
• Matthias Jakob Schleiden , a botanist, in 1838 determined that all plants consist of
cells
15
• Theodor Schwann , a zoologist, in 1839 determined that all animals consist of cells
16
• Rudolf Virchow proposed the theory that all cells arise from previously existing cells
In 1838, the botanist Matthias Jakob Schleiden and the physiologist Theodor Schwann
discovered that both plant cells and animal cells had nuclei. Based on their observations,
the two scientists conceived of the hypothesis that all living things were composed of cells.
In 1839, Schwann published 'Microscopic Investigations on the Accordance in the Structure
and Growth of Plants and Animals', which contained the ﬁrst statement of their joint cell
theory.
7.2.1 Cell Theory
Schleiden and Schwann proposed spontaneous generation as the method for cell origination,
17
but spontaneous generation (also called abiogenesis ) was later disproven. Rudolf Virchow
famously stated "Omnis cellula e cellula"... "All cells only arise from pre-existing cells." The
parts of the theory that did not have to do with the origin of cells, however, held up to
scientiﬁc scrutiny and are widely agreed upon by the scientiﬁc community today.
The generally accepted portions of the modern Cell Theory are as follows: (1) The cell is the
fundamental unit of structure and function in living things. (2) All organisms are made up
of one or more cells. (3) Cells arise from other cells through cellular division. (4) Cells carry
genetic material passed to daughter cells during cellular division. (5) All cells are essentially
the same in chemical composition. (6) Energy ﬂow (metabolism and biochemistry) occurs
within cells.

7.3 Microscopes
• Allow greater resolution, can see ﬁner detail
• Eye: resolution of ˜ 100 μm
18
• Light microscope : resolution of ˜ 200 nm
• Limited to cells are larger organelles within cells
19
• Confocal microscopy : 2 dimension view
20
• Electron microscope : resolution of ˜0.2 nm
• Laser tweezers: move cell contents
7.4 Cell size
One may wonder why all cells are so small. If being able to store nutrients is beneﬁcial
to the cell, how come there are no animals existing in nature with huge cells? Physical
limitations prevent this from occurring. A cell must be able to diﬀuse gases and nutrients in
and out of the cell. A cell's surface area does not increase as quickly as its volume, and as a
result a large cell may require more input of a substance or output of a substance than it
is reasonably able to perform. Worse, the distance between two points within the cell can
be large enough that regions of the cell would have trouble communicating, and it takes a
relatively long time for substances to travel across the cell.
That is not to say large cells don't exist. They are, once again, less eﬃcient at exchanging
materials within themselves and with their environment, but they are still functional. These
cells typically have more than one copy of their genetic information, so they can manufacture
proteins locally within diﬀerent parts of the cell.
Key concepts: Cell size:
• Is limited by need for regions of cell to communicate
• Diﬀuse oxygen and other gases
21 22
• Transport of mRNA and protein s
• Surface area to volume ratio limited
• Larger cells typically:
• Have extra copies of genetic information
• Have slower communication between parts of cell

308 Structure of Eukaryotic cells
1
Eukaryotic cells feature membrane delimited nucleii containing two or more linear chromo-
2 3 4
some s; numerous membrane-bound cytoplasmic organelles: mitochondria, RER , SER ,
5 6 7
lysosomes, vacuole s, chloroplast s; ribosomes and a cytoskeleton . Also, plants, fungi, and
some protists have a cell wall.
8.1 Structure of the nucleus
The nucleus is the round object in the cell that holds the genetic information (DNA) of the
cell. It is surrounded by a nuclear envelope and has a nucleolus inside.
8.1.1 Nuclear envelope
8
The nuclear envelope is a double-layered plasma membrane like the cell membrane, although
without membrane proteins. To allow some chemicals to enter the nucleus, the nuclear
9
envelope has structures called Nuclear pore s. The nuclear envelope is continuous with the
endoplasmic reticulum.
8.1.2 Nucleolus
The nucleolus appears in a microscope as a small dark area within the nucleus. The nucleolus
10
is the area where there is a high amount of DNA transcription taking place.

8.2 Chromatin
11
Chromosomes consist of chromatin . This is made up of strings of DNA, which typically
12
measure centimeters in length if stretched out. This DNA is wound around a histone core
13
and organized into nucleosome s.
14 15 16
The chromatin must be uncoiled for gene expression and replication . Chromosome

8.3 Endoplasmic reticulum
17 18
The endoplasmic reticulum is a cellular organelle made up of a series of extended folded
intracellular membranes. It is continuous with the nuclear membane.
There are two main types of endoplasmic reticulum:
19
• RER: rough endoplasmic reticulum (site of protein synthesis ) associated with ribosomes
20
• SER: smooth endoplasmic reticulum (site of lipid synthesis )
8.3.1 Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum
21
Proteins are directed to the RER by a signal sequence of a growing polypeptide s on
the ribosome. This is recognised by a signal recognition particle which brings the ribo-
some/polypeptide complex to a channel on the RER called a translocon. At the translocon,
the signal sequence and ribosome/polypeptide complex interact with the translocon to open
it. The signal sequence becomes attached to the translocon. The ribosome can continue to
translate the polypeptide into the lumen of the RER. As synthesis continues, 2 processes
can happen.
1. If the protein is destined to become a membrane bound protein then the protein
synthesis will continue until termination. The ribosome can then dissociate, allowing
protein folding within the RER lumen to occur and continuation to the golgi apparatus
for processing of the polypeptide.
2. Iftheproteinisdestinedforstorageforlatersecretionafterstimulationorforcontinuous
secretion then a protease-enzyme which cuts proteins at the peptide bond-can cut the
signal sequence from the growing polypeptide. Continuation to the golgi etc. can then
occur.

32Endoplasmic reticulum
When produced, proteins are then exported to one of several locations. The proteins are
either modiﬁed for extracellular membrane insertion or secretion. Note, this is in contrast
with ribosomes which do not associate with the RER and produce proteins which will become
cytosolic enzymes for example.
8.3.2 Smooth Endoplasmic Reticulum
22
Smooth endoplasmic reticulum produces enzyme s for lipid and carbohydrate biosynthesis
and detoxiﬁcation RER
8.3.3 Sarcoplasmic Reticulum
This is a specialised form of endoplasmic reticulum found in some muscle cell types-
particularly striated, skeletal muscle. Its main function is diﬀerent from the other 2 types in
that is mainly acts as a storage of calcium. This reticulum has voltage gated channels which
respond to signals from 'motor neurones' to open and release calcium into the cytoplasm.
This can then bring about the next part in muscle contraction.

The golgi apparatus is made up of multiple stacks of bilipid membranes.
• Proteins made on the RER are modiﬁed and then sorted

8.7 Cytoskeleton
Cytoskeleton is a collective term for diﬀerent ﬁlaments of proteins that can give physical
shape within the cell and are responsible for the 'roads' which organelles can be carried
along.
• Gives the cell shape
• Anchors other organelles
• Vital to intracellular transport of large molecules
The cytoskeleton is composed of 3 main types of ﬁlaments:
33
• Actin ﬁlaments (7 nm)
34
• Microtubule s: (25 nm) polymer of tubulin; 13/ring.
35
• Intermediate Filament s
Both actin and microtubules can have associated motor proteins.
8.7.1 Intermediate Filaments
These are rope like ﬁlaments, 8-10nm in diameter and tend to give the structural stability to
cells. Examples inculude Vimentin, neuroﬁlaments and keratin. It is keratin which priniciply
makes up hair, nails and horns.
8.7.2 Actin Filaments
Growth
These ﬁlaments are 2-stranded and composed of dimeric subunits called G-Actin. They
contain a GTP molecule in order to bind (polymerise). As GTP is hydrolysed then the
structure becomes unstable and depolymerisation occurs. The growth of actin ﬁlaments is
concentration dependant-that is, the higher the concentration of free G-actin, the greater
the polymerisation. The are also polar, having a + and a - end (not related to charge) and
polymerisation tends to happen faster at the + end.

2 2 6 12 6 2
• One of most important reactions in history of life:
• source of atmospheric O
2
• ultimately led to aerobic respiration and eukaryotes
• Responsible for bulk of glucose production
• Early experiments showed that mass of plant must be derived from substances in the air,
not the soil
• Experiments with isotopes showed that liberated oxygen comes from water
• Experiments also showed that light is essential but that some reactions (e.g., reduction of
CO ) continue in the dark
2
• Plants do two big, important things during photosynthesis: gain energy (absorb light)
and build sugar (glucose).
• Photosynthesis can be divided into two series of chemical reactions: the light (light-
dependent) reactions and the dark (light-independent) reactions. In light reactions, light
is absorbed; in dark reactions, sugar is built.
• Occurs when plants, algae, and autotrophic bacteria absorb light energy and build glucose.
13.1 Light Reactions
• Part of the electromagnetic spectrum
• Consists of units of energy called photons
• Photons at UV end of spectrum have more energy than those at the red end
• Occur on the surface of thylakoid disks
• Chlorophyll and other plant pigments diﬀerentially absorb photons
• Chlorophyll a: light to chemical energy
• Chlorophyll b: accessory chlorophyll
• Chlorophylls absorb primarily blue and red (green reﬂected back, hence the green
color of plants)
13.1.1 Accessory pigments
• Chlorophyll is a major light gathering pigment
• Absorbs light with considerable eﬃciency (i.e., retaining energy)
• Accessory pigments
• Chlorophyll b
• Carotenoinds
• capture light of wavelengths not captured by chlorophylls
51Photosynthesis
• Confer other colors to plant leaves (autumn colors too)
Photosynthetic steps
• Primary photoevent: light photon captured by photosystem and energy transferred to
electron donated by water
• Electron transport: excited electron is shuttled along imbedded series of electron carriers
to proton pump and electron is transferred to acceptor
• Chemiosmosis: transport of protons back into chloroplast drives synthesis of ATP
13.1.2 The Even More Detailed Light Reactions
What the Light Reactions Do:
The light reactions of photosynthesis occur in chloroplasts in and on the thylakoid disks.
During the light reactions, light energy charges up ATP molecules. More speciﬁcally, light
turns the chloroplast into an acid battery, and this battery charges up ATP.
How the "Chloroplast-Battery" Charges ATP:
The stroma is the ﬂuid inside of the chloroplasts, and it carries a negative charge. This
means that it contains about a "gazillion" extra electrons. The solvent of stroma is water.
The ﬂuid inside the thylakoid disks is positively charged because it contains a lot of hydrogen
(H+) ions. The pH here is low, making the ﬂuid very acidic. The solvent of thylakoid disk
ﬂuid is water.
A chloroplast acts like a battery, because it has separated a strong positive charge and a
strong negative charge in two diﬀerent compartments. Energy is released when H+ ions
(free protons) ﬂow from the inside of a thylakoid disk to the stroma. This is electrical energy,
since it is a ﬂow of charged particles.
The protons pass through special channels (made of protein) in the thylakoid membrane;
this reaction is 'exothermic.' The energy that is given oﬀ is used to fuel this reaction (Pi is
the phosphate ion):
ADP + Pi --> ATP
The proton can go to the negative stroma, but only if it uses its energy to charge up ATP.
Since one reaction wants to go, and the other one doesn't, and since the ﬁrst reaction releases
energy and the second one absorbs energy, the two reactions are known to be 'coupled'
together so that the ﬁrst fuels the second. Of course, a special enzyme must be involved for
this to happen.
Chlorophyll Molecules on a Thylakoid Disk:
Hundreds of chlorophyll molecules cover the surface of a thylakoid disk, making the disk
green. The nonpolar "tails" of the chlorophyll molecule are embedded in the membrane of
the thylakoid.
52“Dark” reactions
13.2 “Dark” reactions
• ATP drives endergonic reactions
• NADPH provides hydrogens for reduction of CO to carbohydrate (C-H bonds)
2
• Occur in the stroma
• First step in carbon ﬁxation
13.2.1 The Detailed Dark Reactions
What the Dark Reactions Do:
The dark reactions build sugar from carbon dioxide gas (CO2), water (H2O), and energy
from ATP molecules that were charged up during the light reactions. The dark reactions
occur in the stroma of a chloroplast. Dark reactions usually occur in the light, but they
don't have to. They'll occur in the dark until the chloroplast's supply of ATP runs out
(usually about 30 seconds).
The Calvin Cycle:
The Calvin Cycle is the fancy name for the metabolic pathway that builds sugar. This
means that it involves a whole lot of chemical reactions, and it uses a lot of diﬀerent enzymes
to catalyze the reactions.
Carbon dioxide gas is stable, therefore the bonds that hold the carbon and oxygen atoms
are strong. Therefore it takes a lot of energy to break the bonds and separate the carbon
atoms from the oxygen atoms. The energy needed to do this comes from ATP molecules.
When inorganic carbon (like from CO2) is being added to an organic molecule (such as
sugar), this is called carbon ﬁxation.
It takes 2 complete turns of the Calvin Cycle to make a glucose molecule.

6115 Genetics
6316 Gregor Mendel and biological
inheritance
1
Charles Darwin , for all he contributed to the science of biology, never knew about the
mechanism by which living things inherit traits from previous generations, or how new traits
arise.
As any schoolchild can tell you, this mechanism of interitance has since been found to be
2
DNA , or deoxyribonucleic acid. DNA allows for stable inheritance of traits: the code in
each strand of DNA is replicated precisely through the pairing of basic units along each
strand. The error rate in this replication is amazingly low; not even one base pair in a
million matches out of sequence.
However, when even one base pair is added to a new strain of DNA in an order diﬀerently
than in the parent chain, it can be the basis of amutation. These changes in DNA sequences
are the microscopic origin of changes in traits of all studied living things. Even the smallest
diﬀerence in a strand of DNA can result in a change in traits that can cost the life of the
organism. Mutations can produce proteins with a new or altered function. In humans, the
3
example of Sickle cell anemia is commonly given as its origin is a diﬀerence of only one
base pair in a section of DNA that encodes red blood cells.
Individual sequences of DNA that encode for speciﬁc proteins are called genes and are the
4
units of heredity. Each one has a set nucleotide , and together all of the genes (and some
sequence of DNA that apparently do not code for any biologically important functions)
5
together make up the entire chromosome
16.1 Mendel
• Discovered principle of genetic segregation via numerous experiments utilizing pea plants
• Inferred the existence of genes through segregation of phenotypes
• Used quantitative methods: counted; ratios
• Work is model of scientiﬁc method
• In particular, observed the F2 progeny, which lead to the discovery of dominant and
recessive traits
• Published work in 1866, went unnoticed
• In 1900 his scientiﬁc paper was “rediscovered”

5 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chromosome
65Gregor Mendel and biological inheritance
• Mendel is acknowledged as founder of Genetics
• still used alphabet letters to designate genes
• still refer to dominant and recessive genes
• still refer to segregation of alleles in meiosis
• principle of segregation applies to all sexually reproducing organisms; Mendel’s results
were immediately applied to humans in 1900
16.2 Mendel’s experiments
• 1856, began experiments with the garden pea, Pisum sativum
• 1865, presented results to the Bruno natural history society, which he helped found
• 1866, published his results in proceedings of the society
• Naegeli encouraged Mendel to reproduce results in another species, which failed because
the species did not undergo true fertilization
• discrete traits in Pisum sativum
• pure-breeding lines
• dominant/recessive alleles
• alleles are two alternate versions of a gene
• gametes contain hybridized chromosomes that are formed during meiosis
• homozygous has two of the same allele
• heterozygous has two diﬀerent alleles
• reciprocal F1 crosses (all exhibiting dominant phenotypes); F2; F3
• counted oﬀspring, noted ratios
• inferred genotypes from phenotypes
• tested hypotheses with testcrosses
• attempted to repeat with another species
16.3 Mendel’s seven pairs of traits
1. Seed form (round or wrinkled)
2. Cotyledon color (green or yellow)
3. Seed coat color (white or colored)
4. Pod form (inﬂated or constricted)
5. Pod color (green or yellow)
6. Flower position (axial or terminal)
7. Plant heights (tall or short)
16.4 Locus
• The location of a speciﬁc gene within a chromosome
66Modern Y chromosome
16.5 Modern Y chromosome
Y-chromosome is the most evolved chromosome. Generally it is thought that if Y- chro-
mosome is present in an individual then he will be male. But if mutation occurs at sex
determining region or zinc factor then it will not code for testis determining factor, and
results in normal female. This type of female's frequency is 1/250000.
16.6 Chromosome phenomena
• X-chromosome inactivation
• Barr bodies
• Nondisjunction: failure of chromosome segregation at meiosis or mitosis
• Results in 2N± 1 chromosome number
• Trisomy 2N + 1
• Usually lethal. Trisomy 21 (Down) exception
• Monosomy 2N ** 1
• Lethal except XO
• Usually maternal origin in humans
16.7 X-chromosome inactivation
In females, one X-chromosone is randomly switched oﬀ forming a Barr body.
16.8 Barr body
Dense region in the nucleus formed by the inactive X-chromosome.
16.9 Human genetic disorders
Down's Syndrome(Mongolism)
Down's Syndrome is usually produced by the nondisjunction of chromosome 21 during
oogenesis and sometimes during spermatogenesis. The individual suﬀering from this type of
syndrome has 47 chromosomes instead of the normal 46. The extra chromosome is not a sex
chromosome but an autosome.
Most cases of mongolism were found to occur in children born by women in their forties.
The aﬀected children, called mongoloids, show mental retardation and have a shorter life
expectancy. Their most prominent feature is the Mongolian folds in their eyes; hence, the
term mongolism.
Klinefelter's Syndrome
67Gregor Mendel and biological inheritance
When an XY-bearing sperm unites with an X-bearing egg, the resulting condition is called
Klinefelter's Syndrome, or sexually undeveloped male. Individuals having the syndrome
show the following characteristics:
• testes are small
• sperms are never produced
• breasts are enlarged
• body hair is sparse
• individuals are mentally defective
The same abnormal meiotic division may occur in females. They produce eggs with XX or
no sex chromosomes. Such egg, when fertilized by a Y-bearing sperm, will not develop (YO).
This is because YO is lethal--it wil cause death to the oﬀspring.
6817 DNA: The Genetic Material
17.1 DNA
DNA stands for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid. That is, a nucleic acid with two sugars. DNA is
the hereditary material of cells and is considered the blueprint of life. DNA is found in all
kingdoms of life. Even most viruses have DNA. A molecule of DNA is chemically stable (it
does not have a 2-prime alcohol group.)
When someone says DNA, they may be referring to one's genetic material on multiple levels:
They may be speaking about a single deoxyribose nucleic acid molecule, a section of a double
helix, a section of a chromosome, or one's entire hereditary composition.
• antiparallel
• Double helix
• Semiconservative replication
• Sequence of nucleotides encodes functional RNA or polypeptide
17.2 Historical perspective
• Mitosis and meiosis
• Regular distribution of chromosomes suggested that they contain hereditary informa-
tion
• Bridges/Morgan, usingDrosophilamelanogastershowedthatgenesareonchromosomes
(1910s)
• Hammerling: nucleus contains hereditary information (1930s)
• Griﬃth: transformation of bacteria (1928)
• Avery, MacLeod, McCarty: transforming substance is DNA (1944)
• Hershey, Chase: DNA is hereditary material of viruses (1952)
• Rosalind Franklin
• Watson and Crick: structure of DNA (1953)
17.3 Hershey-Chase Experiment
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading suggestions that DNA was a
genetic material. Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA
into a bacterium. They did two experiments marking either the DNA in the phage with
a radioactive phophorus or the protein of the phage with radioactive sulfur. With the
bacteria that was infected by the phages with radioactive DNA the DNA in the bacteria
69DNA: The Genetic Material
was radioactive. In the bacteria that was infected with the radioactive protein the bacteria
was radioactive, not the DNA. This proves that DNA is a genetic material and it is passed
on in viruses.
17.4 DNA/RNA components
• Miescher: discovered DNA, 1869
17.4.1 Structure of DNA
DNA is in a double helix structure made up of nucleotides. The "backbone" of the double
helix is composed of phosphates connected to a ﬁve carbon sugar called deoxyribose, . The
"rungs" are composed of nitrogenous bases, Purines and Pyrimidines. Purines contain
Adenine(A) and Guanine(G) and have two rings in their structures. Pyrimidines contain
Cytosine(C) and Thymine (T) and have one ring in their structures.

8020 Mutation
1
A mutation is a permanent change to an organism's genetic material (DNA or RNA).
Mutations are a rare but signiﬁcant biological process, since they provide the variation on
2
which evolution acts and are also the source of cancer.
3
An organism's genetic material is made up of polymers (chains) of four diﬀerent nucleotides ,
like a recipe book written in a language of only four letters. A mutation event is when the
order of the nucleotides in DNA change, usually when the DNA is being copied.
Mutations come in a number of forms:
20.1 Point Mutations
Point mutations are all mutations which involve a single nucleotide. These come in the form
of substitutions, insertions and deletions:
20.2 Substitution
Substitution Mutations: In substitution mutations, a nitrogenous base of a triplet codon of
DNA is replaced by another nitrogen base or some derivative of the nitrogen base, changing
the codon. The altered codon codes for a diﬀerent amino acid substitution.The substitution
mutations are of two types:
1.Transitions: It is the replacement of one purine in a polynucleotide chain by another
purine(A by G or C by A) or one pyrimidine by another pyrimidine(T by C or C by T)
2.Transversions:A base pair substitution involving the substitution of a purine by pyrimidine
or pyrimidine by a purine is called transversion.

20.3.2 Rearrangement
20.3.3 Gene/Exon Duplications
Transposition
Retrotransposition
20.4 Chromosomal mutations
Chromosomal mutations involve changes to entire chromosomes. These mutations are
particularly rare:
20.4.1 Translocation
20.4.2 Fusion
20.4.3 Fission
20.4.4 Segmental Duplication
20.4.5 Chromosomal Duplication
20.4.6 Genome Duplication
20.5 Causes of mutations
20.6 Eﬀects of mutations
Mutations can have a variety of diﬀerent eﬀects depending on the type of mutation, the
signiﬁcance of the piece of genetic material aﬀected and whether the cells aﬀected are germ-
82Further reading
line cells. Only mutations in germ-line cells can be passed on to children, while mutations
elsewhere can cause cell-death or cancer.
Mutations can be classiﬁed by their eﬀects:
20.6.1 Silent Mutation
Silent Mutations are DNA mutations that do not result in a change to the amino acid
sequence or a protein. They may occur in a non-coding region (outside of a gene or within
an intron), or they may occur within an exon in a manner that does not alter the ﬁnal
amino acid chain.
20.6.2 Frameshift
20.6.3 Missense Mutation
Missense mutations are types of point mutations where a single nucleotide is changed to
cause substitution of a diﬀerent amino acid. This in turn can render the resulting protein
nonfunctional. Such mutations are responsible for diseases such as Epidermolysis bullosa.

9122 Classiﬁcation of Living Things
22.0.1 Classiﬁcation of Living Things & Naming
With so many ﬂora and fauna on planet Earth, there must be a method to classify each
organism to distinguish it from others so it can be correctly identiﬁed. Classiﬁcation does
not only apply to biology. For example, supermarkets and grocery stores organise their
products by classifying them. Beverages may occupy one aisle, while cleaning supplies may
occupy another. In science, the practice of classifying organisms is called taxonomy (Taxis
means arrangement and nomos means law). The modern taxonomic system was developed
by the Swedish botanist Carolus (Carl) Linneaeus (1707-1788). He used simple physical
characteristics of organisms to identify and diﬀerentiate between diﬀerent species.
Linneaeus developed a hierarchy of groups for taxonomy. To distinguish diﬀerent levels of
similarity, each classifying group, called taxon (pl. taxa) is subdivided into other groups.
To remember the order, it is helpful to use a mnemonic device. The taxa in hierarchical
order:
• Domain - Archea, Eubacteria, Eukaryote
• Kingdom - Plants, Animals, Fungi, Protists, Eubacteria (Monera), Archaebacteria
• Phylum
• Class
• Order
• Family
• Genus
• Species
The domain is the broadest category, while species is the most speciﬁc category available.
The taxon Domain was only introduced in 1990 by Carl Woese, as scientists reorganise
things based on new discoveries and information. For example, the European Hare would
be classiﬁed as follows:
Eukaryote --> Animal --> Chordata --> Mammalia --> Lagomorpha --> Leporidae -->
Lepus --> Lepus europaeus.
Binomial nomenclature is used to name an organism, where the ﬁrst word beginning
with a capital is the genus of the organism and the second word beginning with lower-case
letter is the species of the organism. The name must be in italics and in Latin, which was
the major language of arts and sciences in the 18th century. The scientiﬁc name can be also
abbreviated, where the genus is shortened to only its ﬁrst letter followed by a period. In our
example, Lepus europaeus would become L. europaeus'.
Taxonomy and binomial nomenclature are both speciﬁc methods of classifying an organism.
They help to eliminate problems, such as mistaken identity and false assumptions, caused
by common names. An example of the former is the fact that a North American robin is
93Classiﬁcation of Living Things
quite diﬀerent from the English robin. An example of the latter is the comparison between
crayﬁsh and catﬁsh, where one might believe that they both are ﬁsh when in fact, they are
quite diﬀerent.
Nomenclature is concerned with the assignment of names to taxonomic groups in agreement
with published rules.
22.0.2 Eukaryotes & Prokaryotes
Recall that there are two basic types of cells: eukaryotes and prokaryotes.
Eukaryotes are more complex in structure, with nuclei and membrane-bound organelles.
Some characteristics of eukaryotes are:
• Large (100 - 1000 μm)
• DNA in nucleus, bounded by membrane
• Genome consists of several chromosomes.
• Sexual reproduction common, by mitosis and meiosis
• Mitochondria and other organelles present
• Most forms are multicellular
• Aerobic
Prokaryotes refer to the smallest and simplest type of cells, without a true nucleus and no
membrane-bound organelles. Bacteria fall under this category. Some characteristics:
• Small (1-10 μm)
• DNA circular, unbounded
• Genome consists of single chromosome.
• Asexual reproduction common, not by mitosis or meiosis.
• No general organelles
• Most forms are singular
• Anaerobic
22.0.3 The Three Domains
The three domains are organised based on the diﬀerence between eukaryotes and prokaryotes.
Today's living prokaryotes are extremely diverse and diﬀerent from eukaryotes. This fact has
been proven by molecular biological studies (e.g. of RNA structure) with modern technology.
The three domains are as follows:
Archea (Archeabacteria) consists of archeabacteria, bacteria which live in extreme
environments. The kingdom Archaea belongs to this domain.
Eubacteriaconsistsofmoretypicalbacteriafoundineverydaylife. ThekingdomEubacteria
belongs to this domain.
Eukaryote encompasses most of the world's visible living things. The kingdoms Protista,
Fungi, Plantae, and Animalia fall under this category.
94Stem cells
22.0.4 The Six Kingdoms
Under the three domains are six kingdoms in taxonomy. The ﬁrst two, Plants andAnimals,
are commonly understood and will not be expounded here.
Protista, the third kingdom, was introduced by the German biologist Ernst Haeckel in
1866 to classify micro-organisms which are neither animals nor plants. Since protists are
quite irregular, this kingdom is the least understood and the genetic similarities between
organisms in this kingdom are largely unknown. For example, some protists can exhibit
properties of both animals and plants.
Fungi are organisms which obtain food by absorbing materials in their bodies. Mushrooms
and moulds belong in this kingdom. Originally, they were part of the plant kingdom but
were recategorised when they were discovered not to photosynthesise.
Eubacteria are bacteria, made up of small cells, which diﬀer in appearance from the
organisms in the above kingdoms. They lack a nucleus and cell organelles. They have cell
walls made of peptidoglycan.
Archae (or Archaebacteria) are bacteria which live in extreme environments, such as
salt lakes or hot, acidic springs. These bacteria are in their own category as detailed studies
have shown that they have unique properties and features (ex. unusual lipids that are not
found in any other organism)which diﬀer them from other bacteria and which allow them to
live where they live. Their cell walls lack peptidoglycan.
22.0.5 Origins of Diversity
The diversity in our planet is attributed to diversity within a species. As the world changed
in climate and in geography as time passed, the characteristics of species diverged so much
that new species were formed. This process, by which new species evolve, was ﬁrst described
by British naturalist Charles Darwin as natural selection.
For an organism to change, genetic mutations must occur. At times, genetic mutations are
accidental, as in the case of prokaryotes when they undergo asexual reproduction. For most
eukaryotes, genetic mutations occur through sexual reproduction, where meiosis produces
haploid gametes from the original parent cells. The fusion of these haploid gametes into
a diploid zygote results in genetic variation in each generation. Over time, with enough
arrangement of genes and traits, new species are produced. Sexual reproduction creates an
immense potential of genetic variety.
One goal of taxonomy is to determine the evolutionary history of organisms. This can be
achieved by comparing species living today with species in the past. The comparison in
anatomy and structure is based on data from development, physical anatomy, biochemistry,
DNA, behaviour, and ecological preferences. The following are examples of how such data is
used:
• Anatomy:
Although a horse and a human may look diﬀerent, there is evidence that their arm structures
are quite similar. Their arms' sizes and proportions may be diﬀerent, but the anatomical
structures are quite similar. Such evidence reveals that animals in diﬀerent taxa may not
95Classiﬁcation of Living Things
be that diﬀerent. Biological features from a common evolutionary origin are known as
homologous.
• Development
• Biochemistry:
Biochemical analysis of animals similar in appearance have yielded surprising results. For
example, although guinea pigs were once considered to be rodents, like mice, biochemistry
led them to be in their taxon of their own.
22.0.6 Phylogeny, Cladistics & Cladogram
Modern taxonomy is based on many hypotheses' of the evolutionary history of organisms,
known as phylogeny. As with the Scientiﬁc Method, scientists develop a hypothesis on the
history of an animal and utilise modern science and technology to prove the phylogeny.
Cladistics is a classiﬁcation system which is based on phylogeny. Expanding on phylogeny,
cladistics is based on the assumption that each group of related species has one common
ancestor and would therefore retain some ancestral characteristics. Moreover, as these
related species evolve and diverge from their common ancestor, they would develop unique
characteristics. Such characteristics are known as derived characteristics
The principles of phylogeny and cladistics can be expressed visually as a cladogram,
a branching diagram which acts as a family (phylogenetic) tree for similar species. A
cladogram can also be used to test alternative hypotheses for an animal's phylogeny. In
order to determine the most likely cladogram, the derived characteristics of similar species
are matched and analysed.

22.1 Introduction
Viruses are the smallest biological particle (the tiniest are only 20 nm in diameter). However,
they are not biological organisms so they are not classiﬁed in any kingdom of living things.
They do not have any organelles and cannot respire or perform metabolic functions. Viruses
are merely strands of DNA or RNA surrounded by a protective protein coat called a capsid.
Viruses only come to life when they have invaded a cell. Outside of a host cell, viruses are
completely inert.
Since ﬁrst being identiﬁed in 1935, viruses have been classiﬁed into more than 160 major
groups. Viruses are classiﬁed based on their shape, replication properties, and the diseases
that they cause. Furthermore, the shape of a virus is determined by the type and arrangement
of proteins in its capsid. Viruses pathogenic to humans are currently classiﬁed into 21 groups.
Viruses can also attack bacteria and infect bacterial cells. Such viruses are called bacterio-
phages.
97Classiﬁcation of Living Things
22.2 Viral Replication
As previously stated, viruses are not a biological life form so they cannot reproduce by
themselves. They need to take over a functioning eukaryotic or prokaryotic cell to replicate
its DNA or RNA and to make protein coat for new virus particles.
In order to enter a cell, a virus must attach to a speciﬁc receptor site on the plasma membrane
of the host cell. The proteins on the surface of the virus act as keys which ﬁt exactly into a
matching glycoprotein on the host cell membrane. In some viruses, the attachment protein
is not on the surface of the virus but is in the capsid or in the envelope.
There are two forms of viral replication: the lytic cycle and the lysogenic cycle.
22.2.1 Lytic Cycle
1. Attachment: The virus binds to speciﬁc receptors on the host cell.
2. Entry: There are two ways in which a virus can enter cells. Firstly, the virus can inject
its nucleic acid into the host cell. Secondly, if a virus is contained in an envelope, the
host cell can phagocytosise the entire virus particle into a vacuole. When the virus
breaks out of the vacuole, it then releases its nucleic acid into the cell.
3. Replication: The virus's nucleic acid instructs the host cell to replicate the virus's
DNA or RNA.
4. Assembly: New virus particles are assembled.
5. Lysis and Release: The virus directs the production of an enzyme which damages
the host cell wall, causing the host cell to swell and burst. The newly formed virus
particles are now released.
22.2.2 Lysogenic Cycle
1. Attachment: Similar to Lytic Cycle
2. Entry: Similar to Lytic Cycle
3. Incorporation: The viral nucleic acids is not replicated, but instead integrated by
genetic combination (crossing over) into the host cell's chromosome. When integrated
in a host cell this way, the viral nucleic acid as part of the host cell's chromosome is
known as a prophage.
4. Host Cell Reproduction: The host cell reproduces normally. Subsequent cell divisions,
daughter cells, contain original father cell's chromosome embedded with a prophage.
5. Cycle Induction: Certain factors now determine whether the daughter cell undergoes
the lytic or lysogenic cycle. At any time, a cell undergoing the lysogenic cycle can
switch to the lytic cycle.
The reproduction cycle of viruses with RNA and no DNA is slightly diﬀerent. A notable
example of a RNA-based virus is HIV, a retrovirus.
98Viral Genome
Retrovirus reproductive cycle
1. The retrovirus force RNA into cell, by either one of the two methods of entry (See
above).
2. In the retrovirus are reverse transcriptase enzymes, which catalyses the synthesis of a
DNA strand complementary to the viral RNA.
3. Reverse transcriptase catalyses a second DNA strand complementary to the ﬁrst. With
these two strands, the double-stranded DNA can be created.
4. DNA is then incorporated into the host cell's chromosomes. Similar to the concept of
a prophage, this incorporated DNA is called a provirus. However, the provirus never
leaves the host cell, unlike a prophage.
5. The infected host cell undergoes the lytic or lysogenic cycle.
22.3 Viral Genome
The genome of a virus consists of DNA or RNA, whose size and conﬁguration vary. The
entire genome can exist as a single nucleic acid molecule or several nucleic acid segments.
Also, the DNA or RNA may be single-stranded or double-stranded, and either linear or
circular.
Not all viruses can reproduce in a host cell by themselves. Since viruses are so small, the
size of their genome is limiting. For example, some viruses have coded instructions for only
making a few diﬀerent proteins for the viruses' capsid. On the other hand, the human
genome codes for over 30,000 diﬀerent proteins. Therefore, the lack of coded instructions
cause some viruses to need the presence of other viruses to help them reproduce themselves.
Such viruses are called replication defective.
Lastly, it is worthy to note that 70% of all viruses are RNA viruses. As the process of RNA
replication (with enzymes and other organelles of the host cell) is more prone to errors, RNA
viruses have much higher mutation rates than do DNA viruses.
22.4 Viruses Practice Questions
1. As the name implies, the Tomato Spotted Wilt Virus targets tomatoes. Would it be
possible for this virus to target other fruits as well? Explain.
2. If a DNA and a RNA virus both infected somatic cells, which virus would be more
diﬃcult to detect?
3. Many people have had cold sores, which are caused by infection with the herpes
simplex virus. One characteristic of cold sores is that after a period of inactivity, they
will reappear many times during the course of a person's life. Which cycle would the
herpes simplex virus undergo?
4. Chicken pox is a common, non-fatal disease usually acquired in adolescence and caused
by the varicella zoster virus. In adulthood, many people suﬀer from shingles, an altered
form of the varicella zoster virus. Which cycle would the varicella zoster virus have
undergone?
5. Would an antibiotic work for a person suﬀering from a cold of ﬂu? Explain.

100Domains of life: characteristics
22.7 Domains of life: characteristics
This text is based on notes very generously donated by Paul Doerder, Ph.D., of the Cleveland
State University.
22.8 Introduction
Out of the six kingdoms, Protista is the most diverse. This is the kingdom of organisms
with strange, atypical characteristics. In essence, this kingdom is designated for organisms
which do not belong in any other kingdom. The majority of protists are microscopic.
22.9 Classiﬁcation of Protists
There are three phyla of protists, based on their type of nutrition.
1. Protozoa (animal-like protists) are heterotrophs that ingest or absorb their food.
2. Algae (plant-like protists) are autotrophs they get nutrition from photosythesis.
3. Slime moulds and water moulds (fungus-like protists) are also heterotrophs, like
protozoa.
22.10 Protozoa
As heterotrophs, protozoa scavenge materials from their surroundings. Others are predators
which actively hunt or ambush small organisms such as bacteria and other protozoa for a
source of nutrition. Protozoa can be parasitic as well; they may live inside larger organisms,
like humans. Most protozoa live as single cells, although a few form colonies.
Protozoa are generally diﬃcult to identify due to their varied shape. They may appear as
jelly-like blobs, spherical sunbursts, or a ﬂattened leaf. Tiny blood parasites may be only 2
μm long. On the other hand, shell-covered marine may be 5 cm or more in diameter.
Furthermore, diﬀerent protozoans have their own complex life cycles. The complexity has
led certain organisms to be mistakenly classiﬁed for other species.
Nevertheless, protozoa can move, and so, they are classiﬁed based on their methods of
locomotion.
Characteristics of Protozoa :
• About 30,000 species known
• About 10,000 species are pathogenic, including some of the worst human diseases
• heterotrophic
• highly variable in form and life cycle
101Classiﬁcation of Living Things
• mostly unicellular
• range in size from 0.005 mm to 50 mm
• lack cell walls
they love environment and each other..............
22.11 Algae
Algae are much simpler than protozoa. They are aquatic and contain chlorophyll. Algae can
exist as a single cell or as giant seaweeds 60 m in length. Formerly, algae were classiﬁed as
plants but this was incorrect as algae lack parts of true plants: leaves, stems, roots, xylem,
and phloem. Since algae belong in the kingdom Protista, algae is a broad term used to
denote all aquatic eukaryotes which photosynthesise; algae can diﬀer in size and shape as
well.
There are six phyla of algae:chlorophytes (green algae), phaeophytes (brown algae),
rhodophytes (red algae), chrysophytes (diatoms), pyrrophytes (dinoﬂagellates),
and euglenophytes (euglenoids).
22.11.1 Chlorophytes
Chlorophytes resemble plants the most. Like plants, their cell walls contain cellulose and
they store food in reserve as starch. Chlorophytes can be unicellular or multicellular. Most
chlorophytes use ﬂagellae for some locomotion.
22.11.2 Phaeophytes
Phaeophytes are nearly all multicellular marine organisms, which are known to us as seaweeds.
They have cell walls composed of cellulose and alginic acid (a substance similar to pectin).
The cellulose and alignic acid help to retain water and prevent seawood from drying out
when exposed to air at low tide.
Since phaeophytes live in a tidal environment, they have large, ﬂat fronds (a large leaf)
which can withstand pounding by waves. Their bases strongly anchor the algae to the rocky
seabed and prevent them from being washed out to sea. Phaeophytes are usually found in
areas of cold water.
22.11.3 Rhodophytes
Rhodophytes are typically found in warmer seawater, and are more delicate and smaller
than brown algae (phaeophytes). Rhodophytes are also able to grow at deeper depths in
the ocean, since red algae absorb green, violet, and blue light, the wavelengths of which
penetrate the deepest below the water surface. They also have mucilaginous material to
resist drying.
102Slime molds & Water molds
22.11.4 Chryosophytes
Chryosophytes are the most abundant unicellular algae in the oceans. They are also one
of the biggest components of plankton, a free-ﬂoating collection of microorganisms, eggs,
and larvae. As photosynthetic organisms, they produce a signiﬁcant amount of atmospheric
oxygen.
The reproduction cycle of chryosophytes is particularly interesting. Note that diatoms
reproduce both asexually and sexually. Since diatoms have a rigid cell wall with an outer
layer of silica (found in sand and glass), the daughter cells produced by mitosis must ﬁt
inside the original cell wall. Therefore, each generation of diatoms is smaller than the one
before. The reduction in size continues until the diatoms produce sexually, producing a
zygote which eventually grows to the original size as it matures.
22.11.5 Pyrrophytes
Pyrrophytes are unicellular, photosynthetic, and mostly aquatic. They have protective coats
composed of stiﬀ cellulose. They are more easily identiﬁable, due to the presence of two
ﬂagellae. The longer ﬂagellae propels the dinoﬂagellate, while the second shorter, ﬂatter
ﬂagellae functions as a rudder.
Some species of pyrrophytes are zooxanthellae. Since they lack cellulose plates, they make
their home in coral reefs and animals, such as sea anemones, and molluscs. In returning
the favour of sheltering them, dinoﬂagellates provide carbohydrates to their host through
photosynthesis. This is why there are nutrient-rich coral reefs in malnutritions water.
A negative aspect of pyrrophytes is that under certain conditions, species of dinoﬂagellates
reproduce rapidly to form a harmful algal bloom (HAB), known as a red tide if dinoﬂag-
ellates are the cause. Such pyrrophytes can produce toxins which may injure or kill wildlife,
and additionally any consumers of contaminated wildlife.
22.11.6 Euglenophytes
Like pyrrophytes, euglenophytes are small unicellular freshwater organisms with two ﬂagella.
They are mainly autotrophic or heterotrophic, depending if they have a red, light-sensitive
structure called an eyespot.
22.12 Slime molds & Water molds
There are two phyla of slime moulds and one phylum of water moulds.
22.12.1 Oomycotes (Water moulds)
Oomycotes are ﬁlamentous organisms which resemble fungi, in that they live as saprotrophs.
Oomycotes diﬀer from other moulds with the presence of spores and their sexual life cycle.
103Classiﬁcation of Living Things
22.12.2 Myxomycotes (Plasmodial slime moulds)
Myxomycotiesarevisibletothenakedeyeastinyslug-likeorganismswhichcreepoverdecayed
and dead matter. This streaming blob containing many nuclei is called a plasmodium.
22.12.3 Acrasiomycotes (Cellular slime moulds) and its reproductive
cycle
Acrasiomycotes exist as individual amoeboid cells with one nucleus each. When in un-
favourable conditions, each acrasiomycete cell gathers together to form a pseudoplasmod-
ium.
Reproductive Cycle:
1. One acrasiomycete cell joins with others to form a pseudoplasmodium.
2. The pseudoplasmodium shrinks and forms a smaller plasmodium.
3. The plasmodium migrates to a suitable environment.
4. The plasmodium develops a sporangia, where original parental nuclei has divided by
meiosis into haploid spores to be germinated.
5. When favourable conditions arise, the spores germinate and are carried away by animals
or the wind.
6. Cycle repeats.

23.23 Introduction
Although you may not recognise fungi, they are just as prevalent as plants and animals.
Their spores are in the air which we breathe, fungi allow us to make bread, and mushrooms
(a type of fungi) are eaten by us. A few types of fungi are unicellular. For example, yeasts live
as individual oval or cylindrical cells. However, the majority of fungi live are multicellular.
Their bodies are composed of hyphae, a network of ﬁne ﬁlaments. In a mushroom, the
111Multicellular Photosynthetic Autotrophs
hyphae are densely packed so it is diﬃcult to see the individual structures when a mushroom
is eaten. However, a mushroom is only a specialised reproductive part of the whole fungus.
The main part of the fungi is underground in a whole web of hyphae, called a mycelium.
In the mycelium, each fungal cell is separated from each other by a septum. Each fungal
cell may have one or more nuclei and remains connected to the mycelium because the septa
are porous, allowing cytoplasm to ﬂow through the hyphae and fungal cell walls, made of a
hard material called chitin. Some fungi do not have septa, and they appear to be large,
branching, multinucleate cells.
23.24 Nutrition
Fungi are saprophytes. When they ﬁnd a source of food (e.g. dead wood, orange peel) ,
they decompose it and digest it. The enzymes break down larger organic molecules in the
substrate into smaller molecules. These smaller molecules diﬀuse into the fungus, where
they are used to allow growth and repair.
Fungi which feed on living cells are parasitic. For example, athlete's foot grows on the
human foot. These kinds of fungi produce hyphae called haustoria, which can penetrate
host cells without immediately killing them.
However, they are friendlier species of fungi. Many fungi live symbiotically with plants or
animals. For example, most trees have fungi living in close contact with their roots. In this
relationship, known as a mycorrhiza, there are many beneﬁts:
• Growing around the plant roots and often entering plant cells, the hyphae absorb minerals
from the soil and release them in the roots. The fungi gets its source of food (organic
nutrients) while delivering food to the plant.
• The mycelium here would increase the surface area, thus the absorptive surface, of the
plant roots.
• The fungal cells help to maintain air and water ﬂow in the soil around the roots.
• The fungi may prevent other potentially pathogenic fungi to attack the tree.
23.25 Fungal Reproduction
Fungi can reproduce in two ways. Firstly, they make asexually produce through frag-
mentation. This occurs when pieces of hyphae are broken oﬀ, which then grow into new
mycelia.
The second method is by spores. Spores are lightweight structures and windblown designed
to be transported over long distances and by many mediums, such as on the bodies of insects
and birds. They are additionally light enough to be blown away for hundreds of kilometers.
Spores may be asexual and sexual. Their sexual properties can be analysed to classify the
four phylla of fungi.
112Types of Fungi
23.26 Types of Fungi
23.26.1 Zygospore Fungi (Zygomycetes)
This phyllum includes bread moulds and other saprotrophs. Comparable to bacteria, this
phyllum prefers asexual reproduction over sexual reproduction.
1. Two haploid hyphae of opposite types, also known as mating strain + and mating
strain -, combine and fuse together.
2. Plasmogamy, the union of the two parent hyphae, occurs and results in the creation
of a heterokaryotic (n + n) zygosporangium or zygospore. Note that the zygospore is
NOT diploid yet; the haploid nuclei are simply clumped together.
3. Immediately, a thick wall develops around the zygospore to protect it from drying and
other hazards. The zygospore becomes dormant.
4. When conditions are favourable, the zygospore absorbs water and undergoes karyogamy
(n + n = 2n), where the haploid nuclei contributed by the two parents fuse to produce
diploid zygosporangia.
5. The now diploid zygosporangium then undergoes meiosis to form haploid sporangia.
6. Through asexual reproduction of fungi (See above for more information), the spores from
the sporangia germinate and grow into new mycelia.
7. Back to step #1.
23.26.2 Club Fungi (Basidiomycetes)
This phyllum increases mushrooms and shelf fungi. In many ways, the reproduction stages
of this phyllum is similar to that of zygomycetes.
1. Two haploid hyphae of opposite types, also known as mating strain + and mating
strain -, combine and fuse together.
2. Plasmogamy takes place, and a dikaryotic mycelium forms. The dikaryotic mycelium
grows faster then the haploid parental mycelia.
3. Environmental factors cause the dikaryotic mycelium to form compact masses which de-
velop into basidiocarps, short-lived reproductive structures. An example is the mushroom.
4. The basidiocarp gills are lined with terminal dikaryotic cells called basidia, which then
undergo karyogamy.
5. The basidia are now diploid. They undergo meiosis to develop haploid basidiospores, a
term referring to a basidiomycete's spores.
6. Stillremainingonthebasidiocarp, thehaploidbasidiosporeseject,fallfromthebasidiocarp,
and are dispersed by the wind when mature.
7. In a favourable environment, the basidiospores germinate and grow into short-lived
haploid mycelia.

23.27 Key Terms
synapomorphy
23.28 Introduction
What makes an animal an animal?
If animals are a monophyletic taxon, then animals should be able to be deﬁned by synapomor-
phies, (shared, derived characteristics). Ideally, we would NOT deﬁne this or any taxon using
symplesiomorphies (shared ancestral or primitive characteristics) or homoplastic characters
(the independent evolution of similarity, or "convergent evolution"). See pages 654 - 656 and
Fig. 32.6 in your text to review these concepts. As you consider the characteristics listed
below, ask yourself whether or not each is a synapomorphy.
23.29 Characteristics of an Animal
• There is no one universally accepted deﬁnition of an animal. The following treatment
follows your text, beginning on page 876.
• Animals:
• Are multicellular, heterotrophic eukaryotes ...
• Lack the distinctive cell walls of plants & fungi
• Share unique characteristics ...
• Share certain reproductive characteristics ...
• Other commonly used deﬁnitions ...
Animals are multicellular heterotrophic eukaryotes
• Unfortunately, none of these traits is exclusive to animals:
• Plants, fungi, and some algae are multicellular.
• Many bacteria, protists, and all fungi are heterotrophic.
• Everything other than bacteria and archaea are eukaryotic.
• Moreover, all three of these characteristics also apply to fungi.
• However, there is a diﬀerence here between animals and fungi. Animals generally
take in their food through ingestion, or eating and swallowing something. Fungi are
absorptive heterotrophs; they secrete their digestive enzymes onto their food, and then
absorb the resulting nutrients.
Animals share unique characteristics
• Only animals have muscle tissue and nervous tissue.
• Only animals have collagen, a structural protein
• Only animals have the following types of intercellular junctions: (See pages 135 - 139,
Figure 7.15 in your text for more information on these junctions.)
114Characteristics of an Animal
• Tight junctions (sealing function)
• Desmosomes (anchoring function)
• Gap junctions (communication function)
Animals share certain reproductive characteristics
• Most animals reproduce sexually, with the diploid stage dominating.
• In most animals, a small, haploid, ﬂagellated, motile sperm fertilizes a larger, haploid,
nonmotile egg to form a diploid zygote.
• Mitotic division of the zygote yields a blastula stage, followed by a gastrula stage. A
synapomorphy? This feature could be another "unique characteristic" shared by animals.
• Development may be direct to adult form, or there may be a sexually immature stage
(or stages) that are morphologically & ecologically distinct from the adult called a larva
(plural: larvae).
Other commonly used deﬁnitions or characterizations
• It is surprisingly diﬃcult to ﬁnd two texts that agree on a precise deﬁnition of an animal.
Here are a few perspectives from some other texts.
• Animals are multicellular eukaryotes; they are chemosynthetic heterotrophs that ingest
their food.
• Animals are motile, though many are secondarily sessile. Gametes usually are produced
inmulticellularsexorgans, andthezygotepassesthroughembryonicstagesthatinclude
a blastula.
• Animals are organisms that are multicellular, with more than one type of cell. They
are heterotrophic. They reproduce sexually (at least sometimes), with a zygote formed
from two diﬀerent haploid gametes. They go through a developmental stage called a
blastula.
• Animals are not photosynthetic, have no cell wall, and no hyphae or mycelia. (What
would a cladist think of this deﬁnition of the taxon Animalia?)
What kinds of animals are there?
• Kingdom Animalia generally is recognized to have approximately 30 phyla ...
• There is relatively little dispute over the number of phyla recognized; however, the
phylogenetic relationships among the phyla are hotly debated.
• Molecular techniques for assess similarity based on nucleotide sequences in nucleic
acids are providing valuable new perspectives on this question.
• Remember that two animals in diﬀerent phyla generally are considered to be more diﬀerent
from each other than are animals within one phylum (e.g., nematodes are more diﬀerent
from annelids than humans are from sharks).

23.31 Phylum Porifera
Figure 6 Sponges
Name means "pore-bearing".
This phylum consists of the sponges. The number of species is estimated to be between
5,000 and 10,000. All are aquatic and almost all are marine.
Animals in this phyla have no true tissues, which means, for example, that they have no
nervous system or sense organs. Although sponges are multicellular, they are described as
being essentially at a cellular level of organization. They are sessile as adults, but have a
free swimming larva.
Their bodies are porous. They are ﬁlter feeders; water ﬂows in through many small openings,
and out through fewer, large openings. They have inner and outer cell layers, and a variable
middle layer. The middle layer often is gelatinous with spiny skeletal elements (called
spicules) of silica or calcium carbonate, and ﬁbres made of spongin (a form of collagen).
117Multicellular Photosynthetic Autotrophs
Choanocytes are ﬂagellated cells lining the inside of the body that generate a current, and
trap and phagocytize food particles.
Their cells remain totipotent, or developmentally ﬂexible: they can become any type of
cell at any point in the sponge's development. This allows for the great regenerative power
sponges have.
Sponges are an ancient group, with fossils from the early Cambrian (ca. 540 mya) and
possibly from the Precambrian. Sponges often are abundant in reef ecosystems. They
somehow are protected from predators (spicules? bad taste?).
Many organisms are commensals of sponges, living inside them. Some sponges harbor
endosymbiotic cyanobacteria or algae (dinoﬂagellates, a.k.a. "zooxanthellae").
23.32 Phylum Cnidaria
See text pages 886 - 889.
Name comes from the Greek knide- meaning "nettle".
This phylum They have one opening, which serves as both mouth and anus. The body wall
has an outer ectoderm, an inner endoderm, and a variable undiﬀerentiated middle layer
called mesoglea or mesenchyme that may be jelly-like. The mesoglea is NOT considered
to be true mesoderm and so the Cnidaria are described as diploblastic. Tentacles usually
extend from the body wall around the mouth/anus.
118Phylum Cnidaria
Figure 7 Jellyﬁsh Development
14 15
There are two basic body plans: the polyp and the medusa . The polyp is sessile and
attaches to substrate by the aboral end (i.e., the end away from the mouth). The medusa
("jellyﬁsh") is a ﬂoating form, and looks like an upside-down version of the polyp. Some
cnidarians only have the polyp stage, some have only the medusa stage, and others have
both.
14 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polyp
15 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medusa%20%28biology%29
119Multicellular Photosynthetic Autotrophs
The typical life cycle of a cnidarian involves what is called "alternation of generations": an
alternation between an asexual polyp stage and a sexual medusa stage.
The tentacles are armed with cnidae (or nematocysts), small intracellular "harpoons" that
function in defense and prey capture. When ﬁred, the cnidae deliver a powerful toxin that
in some cases is dangerous to humans. The phylum is named after the cnidae.
Cnidarians have no head, no centralized nervous system, and no specialized organs for gas
exchange, excretion, or circulation. They do have a "nerve net."
Many cnidarians have intracellular algae living within them in a mutualistic symbiotic
relationship (Dinoﬂagellates = zooxanthellae). This combination is responsible for much of
the primary productivity of coral reefs.
There are three main classes in the phylum
16
• Class Hydrozoa (hydras and Portugese man-of-war are well-known but atypical examples
of this Class)
17
• Class Scyphozoa (jellyﬁsh)
• The medusa stage is dominant and the polyp stage often is reduced.
18
• Class Anthozoa (sea anemones, most corals)
• No medusa (jellyﬁsh) stage, so sexual reproduction occurs in the polyp stage in this
group. The polyps also can reproduce asexually, which is how individual "corals" grow.
23.33 Phylum Platyhelminthes
See text pages 890 - 893.
Name means "ﬂat worm"
Most members of this phylum are parasitic (ﬂukes and tapeworms), but some are free living
(e.g., planaria). There are about 20,000 species.
They are dorsoventrally compressed (i.e., "ﬂat").
Animals in this phylum are acoelomate, triploblastic, bilaterally symmetrical, and unseg-
mented. Platyhelminths have a simple anterior "brain" and a simple ladder-like nervous
system. Their gut has only one opening. Flatworms have NO circulatory or gas exchange
systems. They do have simple excretory/osmoregulatory structures (protonephridia or "ﬂame
cells").
Platyhelminths are hermaphroditic, and the parasitic species often have VERY complex
reproductive (life) cycles.
There are four main classes of platyhelminths:
19
• Class Turbellaria (mostly free living ﬂatworms, e.g., planaria)
16 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrozoa
17 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scyphozoa
18 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthozoa
19 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbellaria
120Phylum Rotifera
20
• Class Monogenea (parasitic ﬂukes)
21
• Class Trematoda (parasitic ﬂukes, e.g., liver ﬂuke and the human blood ﬂuke, Schisto-
soma)
22
• Class Cestoda (tapeworms)
• Cestodes are endoparasitic in the gut of vertebrates. They do not have a mouth or
digestive system.
23.34 Phylum Rotifera
See text page 900
The Rotifers. The name means "wheel bearing," a reference to the corona, a feeding structure
(see below).
They are triploblastic, bilaterally symmetrical, and unsegmented. They are considered
pseudocoelomates.
Most less than 2 mm, some as large as 2 - 3 mm.
Rotifers have a three part body: head, trunk foot. The head has a ciliary organ called the
corona that, when beating, looks like wheels turning, hence the name of the phylum. The
corona is a feeding structure that surrounds the animal's jaws. The gut is complete (i.e.,
mouth & anus), and regionally specialized. They have protonephridia but no specialized
circulatory or gas-exchange structures.
Most live in fresh water, a very few are marine or live in damp terrestrial habitats. They
typically are very abundant. There are about 2,000 species.
Parthenogenesis, where females produce more females from unfertilized but diploid eggs, is
common. Males may be absent (as in bdelloid rotifers) or reduced. When males are present,
sexual and asexual life cycles alternate. Males develop from unfertilized haploid eggs and
are haploid. Males produce sperm by mitosis which can fertilize haploid eggs, yielding a
diploid zygote that develops into a diploid female. Sexual reproduction occurs primarily
when living conditions are unfavorable.
Most structures in rotifers are syncytial ("a mulitnucleate mass of protoplasm not divided into
separate cells," or "a multinucleated cell") and show eutely (here, "constant or near-constant
number of nuclei").
23.35 Phylum Nematoda
See text pages 894 - 895.
Name from the Greek for "thread".
20 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monogenea
21 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trematoda
22 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cestoda
121Multicellular Photosynthetic Autotrophs
This phylum consists of the round worms. There are about 12,000 named species but the
true number probably is 10 - 100 times this!
These animals are triploblastic, bilaterally symmetrical, unsegmented pseudocoelomates.
They are vermiform, or wormlike.
In cross-section, they are round, and covered by a layered cuticle (remember this cuticle !!).
Probably due to this cuticle, juveniles in this phylum grow by molting. The gut is complete.
They have a unique excretory system but they lack special circulatory or gas-exchange
structures. The body has only longitudinal muscle ﬁbers. The sexes are separate.
Nematodes can be incredibly common, widespread, and of great medical and economic
importance. They are parasites of humans and our crops. They can live pretty much
anywhere.
In one rotting apple, there can be up to 90,000 nematodes, and in one tablespoon of coastal
mud, there can be 236 species of nematodes!
Nematodes can be free living or important parasites of our crops, or of humans and other
animals. They have become very important in development studies, especially the species
Caenorhabditis elegans, presumably due to its small size and constancy of cell number
(eutely - 959 cells in C. elegans).
23.36 Phylum Annelida
See text pages 906 - 909.
Name means "ringed", from the Greek annulatus.
This phylum consists of earthworms, leeches, and various marine worms given many diﬀerent
names (e.g., sand worms, tube worms). There are about 12,000 - 15,000 species.
Animals in this phylum are triploblastic, bilaterally symmetrical, segmented coelomates.
Development is typically protostomous. They have a complete circulatory system, and
a well-developed nervous system. Typically, each segment has paired epidermal "bristles"
(setae or chaetae).
Most are marine but they are successful occupants of almost anywhere suﬃcient water is
available. They can be free living, parasitic, mutualistic, or commensalistic.
Major advances of this phylum include the true coelom, segmentation, both longitundinal
and circular muscles, a closed circulatory system and, for most, a more advanced excretory
system (metanephridia).
There are three main classes of Annelids
• Class Oligochaeta (earthworms)
• Class Polychaeta (marine worms)
• Class Hirudinea (leeches)
122Phylum Arthropoda
23.37 Phylum Arthropoda
Figure 8 Arthropods
Name means "jointed feet".
This phylum consists of spiders, ticks, mites, insects, lobsters, crabs, and shrimp, and is the
largest of all the phyla. So far, over 1 million species have been named, and it is likely that
the true number out there is 10 - 100 times greater.
This phylum also includes the extinct trilobites, which were prevalent in the Paleozoic era.
Because of their exoskeletons, these animals fossilized well and over 4000 species have been
named.
These animals are triploblastic, bilaterally symmetrical, segmented, protostome coelomates.
The coelom is generally reduced to portions of the reproductive and excretory systems. They
have an open circulatory system.
Themostnotableadvancementofthisphylumisarigidexoskeleton. Ithasmajorimplications
in these organisms' locomotion, ﬂexibility, circulatory systems, gas exchange systems, and
growth. It also was partially responsible for the ability of the arthropods to move on to land.
There are several major groupings of arthropods:
Major subgroups include:
• The chelicerates (eurytperids, horseshoe crabs, scorpions, spiders, ticks) have clawlike
feeding appendages. They lack antennae and usually have simple eyes.
• The Trilobites...they get their own grouping
123Multicellular Photosynthetic Autotrophs
• The uniramians (centipedes, millipedes, insects) have one pair of antennae and un-
branched (uniramous) appendages.
• The crustaceans (crabs, shrimp, lobsters, barnacles and many others) have two pairs of
antennae and branched (biramous) appendages.
Major Classes Include
• Class Arachnida (mites, scorpions, spiders, ticks)
• Class Diplopoda (millipedes)
• Class Chilopoda (centipedes)
• Class Insecta (insects)
• Class Crustacea (crabs, crayﬁsh, lobsters, shrimp)
23.38 Phylum Mollusca
See text pages 900 - 905.
Name means "soft".
This phylum consists of snails, slugs, bivalves, chitons, squids, octopus, and many others.
About 110,000 species
All molluscs have a similar body plan:
• A muscular foot, usually used for movement.
• A visceral mass, containing most of the internal organs.
• A mantle, a fold of tissue that drapes over the visceral mass and secretes the shell, if
present.
• Most have a radula, or a rasping organ to scrape food.
Molluscs are bilaterally symmetrical, or secondarily asymmetrical. They are coelomates, but
the coelom generally has been greatly reduced; the main body cavity is a hemocoel. Devel-
opment is typically protostomous. The gut is complete with marked regional specialization.
Large, complex, metanephridia (excretion).
Many molluscan life cycles include a trochophore larva. This stage also is characteristic of
annelids.
There are several major classes of molluscs:
• Class Polyplacophora (chitons)
• Class Gastropoda (snails, slugs, nudibranchs)
• Class Bivalvia (clams, mussels, scallops, oysters)
• Class Cephalopoda (squids, octopuses, chambered nautiluses)
23.39 Phylum Echinodermata
Name means "spiny skin"
This phylum consists of sea stars, brittle stars, sea urchins, and sea cucumbers.
124Phylum Chordata
Echinoderms are mostly sessile or very slow moving animals.
As adults, they are radially symmetrical, but in the larval stage, they are bilaterally
symmetrical. They are considered deuterostomes.
Echinoderms are unique in that they have a water vascular system composed of a system
of ﬂuid-ﬁlled canals. These canals branch into the tube feet, which function in feeding,
locomotion, and gas exchange.
There are six major classes of echinoderms:
• Class Asteroidea (sea stars)
• Class Ophiuroidea (brittle stars)
• Class Echinoidea (sea urchins, sand dollars)
• Class Crinoidea (sea lilies)
• Class Holothuroidea (sea cucumbers)
23.40 Phylum Chordata
Name means "the chordates", i.e., these animals have a notochord at some stage in their
lifecycle.
This phylum consists of tunicates, lancelets, and the vertebrates.
There are four major features that characterize the phylum Chordata.
• A notochord, or a longitudinal, ﬂexible rod between the digestive tube and the nerve
cord. In most vertebrates, it is replaced developmentally by the vertebral column. This
is the structure for which the phylum is named.
• A dorsal hollow nerve cord which develops from a plate of ectoderm that rolls into a tube
located dorsal to the notochord. Other animal phyla have solid nerve cords ventrally
located. A chordate nerve cord splits into the central nervous system: the brain and
spinal cord.
• Pharyngeal slits, which allow water that enters through the mouth to exit without
continuing through the entire digestive tract. In many of the invertebrate chordates,
these function as suspension feeding devices; in vertebrates, they have been modiﬁed for
gas exchange, jaw support, hearing, and other functions.
• A muscular, postanal tail which extends posterior to the anus. The digestive tract of
most nonchordates extends the length of the body. In chordates, the tail has skeletal
elements and musculature, and can provide most of the propulsion in aquatic species.
Chordates have a segmented body plan, at least in development. This segmentation evolved
independently from the segmentation of annelids.
Three subphyla make up the phylum Chordata:
• Subphylum Urochordata (tunicates): the adults are enclosed in a tunic made of a carbo-
hydrate much like cellulose. They squirt water out of an excurrent siphon. Urochordates
are characterized by errant (mobile and active) larvae and sessile adults. All are ﬁlter
feeders. The only "chordate" characteristics retained in adult life are the pharyngeal slits.
125Multicellular Photosynthetic Autotrophs
Larval urochordates look more like adult cephlochordates & adult vertebrates than adult
urochordates.
• Subphylum Cephalochordata: Cephalochordates are known as lancelets because of their
blade-like shape; they are also known as amphioxus. They are marine animals and usually
live on the bottom, but can swim.
• Subphylum Vertebrata (vertebrates) ...
Formally, the phyla Urochordata and Cephalochordata are considered invertebrates.
23.40.1 Subphylum Vertebrata
Vertebrata refers to the presence of vertebrae and a vertebral column.
This subphylum includes most of the animals with which most people are familiar.
Vertebrates show extreme cephalization.
The notochord generally is replaced by the cranium & vertebral column in adults.
Neural Crest Cells
Later in development, these give rise to many cells of the body, including some cartilage
cells, pigment cells, neurons & glial cells of the peripheral nervous systems, much of the
cranium, and some of the cells of the endocrine system.
Some scientists would like to classify the neural crest as the fourth germ layer.
Neural crest cells come from the dorsal edge of the neural plate, thus ectoderm.
12624 Chordates
The phylum Chordata includes three subphyla. These include vertebrates and invertebrate
chordates.
24.1 Characteristics
Notochord: the rod-shaped supporting axis found in the dorsal part of the embryos of all
chordates, including vertebrates
Flexible, non-collapsible rod dorsal to the gut/coelom and below the nervous system,
hydrostatic, ﬂuid wrapped in tough connective tissue. As bone does not compact, muscles
tensed on one side result in movement instead of shortening the animal. This allows much
better locomotion than do cilia for larger animals in water, a crucial victory for later success.
Pharyngeal slits: Slits in the pharynx originally used to gather food, water enters the mouth,
passes through pharynx and out gill-like slits, passing through a cavity called an antrium
and then outside. In humans, present only in embryo.
Dorsal nerve cord: A neural tube dorsal to the notochord
Postanal tail: Elongation of the body and notochord, nerve cord and muscles past anus into
tail, early locomotive function led to success.
Non-synapomorphic characteristics (not limited to chordates):
• bisymmetrical (bilateral symmetry)
• segmented muscles and bones
24.2 Subphylum Urochordata
The tunicates are located in this subphylum. Along with the subphylum Cephalochordata,
these two subphyla make up the invertebrate chordates. Only the tunicate larvae have
notochords, nerve cords, and postanal tails. Most adult tunicates are sessile, ﬁlter-feeders
which retain their pharyngeal slits. Adult tunicates also develop a sac, called a tunic,
which gives tunicates their name. Cilia beating within the turnicate cause water to enter
the incurrent siphon. The water enters the body, passes through the pharyngeal slits,
and leaves the body through the excurrent siphon. Undigested food is removed through
the anus. Tunicates are hemaphrodites and can reproduce asexually through budding.In
urochordates notochord is conﬁned to larval tail.These lack cranium. These have an open
type of circulatory system.Excretion is by neural gland,nephrocytes.
127Chordates
24.3 Subphylum Cephalochordata
The lancelets are located in this subphylum. Along with the subphylum Urochordata, these
two subphyla make up the invertebrate chordates. Lancelets receive their name from their
bladelike shape. They resemble ﬁsh but they are actually scaleless chordates only a few
centimeters long. They spend most of their time buried in the sand with their mouths
protruding. Fossils of lancelets have been found to be over 550 million years old.
Dropped out sessile stage, what was the larval stage is now sexually reproductive. Includes
Branchiostoma (“amphioxus”).
24.4 Subphylum Vertebrata
(Vertebra from Latin vertere, to turn). Characterized by separate bones or cartilage blocks
ﬁrmly joined as a backbone. The backbone supports and protects a dorsal nerve cord.
Vertebrates have tissues which are organized into organs which in turn are organized into
organ systems.
All vertebrates share the following characteristics: - segmentation - a true coelom - bilateral
symmetry-cephalization-abackbone-abonyskull-aclosedcirculatorysystem-chambered
heart - two pairs of jointed appendages - tissues organized into organs
Vertebrate Organ Systems: - Nervous System - Circulatory System - Digestive System -
Respiratory System - Reproductive System - Excretory System
• Vertebral column: Not present in higher vertebrate adults. (In humans, the gel-like,
spongy core of the vertebral column is the only remainder. Ruptured or herniated disc is
an injury to this.)
• Cranium: Composite structure of bone/cartilage. Two functions: 1. Supports sensory
organs of head and 2. Encloses or partially encloses the brain.
What evolutionary relationship could we imagine between sessile echinoderms and the higher
chordate animals?
Paedomorphic (child-form) hypothesis: basically, evolution of sexual reproduction in what
had previously been a larval life stage, or the retention of at least one juvenile characteristic
into the adult (adult = sexually reproducing) stage. Some scientists believe that this occurred
in a proto-chordate animal lineage. Maybe chordates (and vertebrates) arose from sessile
(attached) ancestors. Selection in these proto-chordates maybe began to favor more time in
the larval stage, as feeding was more successful or mortality lower in this stage. As larvae
got bigger physics shows that the cilia become less eﬃcient for locomotion, favoring the
undulating motion allowed by a notochord.
Is this hypothesis crazy? A similar example of this today is Epemeroptera, the mayﬂy, which
has almost abandoned its adult stage. Its one-year lifespan is mostly larval with just a brief
day of reproduce-and-die as an adult, which doesn’t even have usable mouthparts.
Tunicate (sea squirt) larva has all four chordate characteristics, although adult sessile
(“attached”).
128Subphylum Vertebrata
24.4.1 Class Agnatha
"jawless ﬁsh"
• Ostracoderms: extinct Agnathans which had primitive ﬁns and massive plates of bony
tissue on their body.
• Cyclostomes: "circle mouth" - a group of Agnathans which is still alive in the form of
lampreys and hagﬁsh.
Appeared approximately 500 million years ago and dominated the oceans for about 100
million years. The ﬁrst group of ﬁsh to appear. They had neither jaws, paired ﬁns, nor
scales, but they were the ﬁrst organisms with a backbone.
Class Acanthodia
"spiny ﬁsh" Appeared about 430 million years ago. An extinct class of ﬁsh that developed
jaws with bony edges. They had internal skeletons made of cartilage and some bone.
Class Placodermi
Appeared about 410 million years ago, dominated the sea for about 50 million years. An
extinct class of ﬁsh with massive heads.
24.4.2 Class Chondrichthyes
"cartilaginous ﬁsh" Appeared about 400 million years ago with bony ﬁsh. Includes sharks,
skates and rays, and chimaeras. Their skeletons are made of cartilage strengthened by the
mineral calcium carbonate.
The main characteristics and distinguishing features of this class: - gills - single-loop blood
circulation - vertebral column - presence of placoid scales on their bodies - internal skeleton
of cartilage - paired, ﬂeshy pectoral and pelvic ﬁns - asymmetrical tail ﬁn prevents sinking -
fatty liver provides neutral buoyancy - visceral clefts present as separate and distinct gills -
no external ear - oviparous - internal fertilization - ectoderms - cold blooded
24.4.3 Class Osteichthyes
"bony ﬁsh" Appeared about 400 million years ago with cartilaginous ﬁsh. Includes about
95% of today's ﬁsh species.
Subclass Sarcopterygii
ﬂeshy-ﬁnned ﬁshes. Fins have bones and muscles, homologous to our limbs.
Order Dipnoi
lung ﬁshes, two groups isolated when continents separated
129Chordates
Order Crossopterygii
includes coelacanths and rhipodistians, gave rise to amphibians, had lungs which evolved
into a swim bladder in bony ﬁshes, and labyrinthodont teeth, characterized by complex
folding of enamel.
• Skeleton made of bone, jaws, ﬁns, most with scales, two-chambered heart.
24.4.4 Class Amphibia
means “both lives”, aquatic larvae, terrestrial adult Amphibians: - Legs - Lungs - Double-
Loop Circulation - Partially Divided Heart - Cutaneous Respiration (Breathes through
Skin)
Order Salientia
frogs (jumping) (aka Anura)
Order Urodela
salamanders (tailed)
Labyrinthodont amphibians: oldest known amphibians, inherited characteristic teeth from
crossopterygii ancestor, had stocky, aquatic larvae.
Amphibians have limbs instead of ﬁns. Girdles and vertebral column now more substantial
and connected, support body on legs.
Lisamphybia: no scales, “smooth”, eggs with no shell, laid in water (water-reliant).
Amphibians gave rise to cotylosaurs, from which arose dinosaurs, turtles, lizards, and
therapsids.
Class Reptilia
amniotic egg allowed freedom from water, shelled egg. (Amnion: protection). Reptiles have
four extra-embryonic membranes:
• Amnion: supports aquatic environment inside egg in ﬂuid sac.
• Allantois: allows gas exchange and elimination of wastes.
• Chorion: gas exchange
• Yolk sac: only one of the four left over from amphibian ancestor
Reptiles cold-blooded, or ectothermic, meaning that their heat come from their environment.
Sometimes deﬁned as all amniotes that are not birds or mammals.
Reptiles can be classiﬁed by skull structure into four groups:
• Anapsid
• Synapsid
• Diapsid
• Euryasid
130Subphylum Vertebrata
Refers to number of holes in the skull. Cotylosaurs had Anapsid skull
Dermatocranium: from bony outer skull structure, precursor to human cranium.
Subclass Anapsidia
Subclass Testudinata
1
turtles , terrapins
Subclass Diapsida
2 3
dinosaurs , snakes , most stuﬀ
Subclass Synapsida
Order Therapsids
Subclass Diapsida
includes Ichthyosaurs, marine reptiles convergent on dolphins; Plesiosaurs, ancient sea
monsters; Squamates, including lizards and snakes; and Thecodonts, which gave rise to
• birds
• dinosaurs
• crocodilians
Dinosaurs: broken into two groups, based on hip structure
• Saurischia: lizard hips (gave rise to birds [!]), ancestrally bipedal
• Ornithischian: bird hips, ancestrally quadripedal
Crocodilians: come from archosaurs, the only extant (still living today) archosaur descendant.
Ancestrally bipedal, secondarily quadripedal.
Synapsids: refers to joined (Greek syn-, together with) parts of skull. Led eventually to
mammals. Synapsid pelycosaur >> therapsid >> mammals
Pelycosaur: Sail-backed dinosaur, legs not spread out like lizard but more pillar-like and
under body, allowing greater activity and competence in motion, pendulum like rather than
constant push-up. Teeth diﬀerentiated into diﬀerent types, for pre-processing of food needed
by higher metabolism. Skull changes, bone histology, suggestions of warm-bloodedness.

131Chordates
Class Aves
arose late Jurassic, early Cretaceous. Feathers, skeleton modiﬁed for ﬂight. Feathers:
epidermal derivative, made of keratin (like ﬁngernails). Carpometacarpis: bears primary
ﬂight feathers, parallel to hand parts. Keeled sternum: breastbone, powerful one needed
to support ﬂight muscles. Strong, light, occasionally hollow bones. All birds lay eggs (as
contrasted to reptiles, which have developed live birthing over 100 independent times.) Why
are there no live-bearing birds? Early birds had teeth, lost them. With mammals, only
exothermic animals.
Archaeopteryx: “ancient wing”, Jurassic bird-reptile, very dinosaur-like. Good fossils found
in Zolenhoﬀen, German sandstone mine with ﬁne sand, shows feathers clearly, found shortly
after Darwin’s publication and used to support his hypothesis. Thick, heavy bones and no
sternum, bony tail, not a good ﬂyer but did have primary ﬂight feathers.
Archaeornithes: includes archaeopteryx.
Paleognathae: gave rise to Australian ﬂightless birds.
Neognathae: remaining live birds.
Class Mammalia
Two unique characteristics, or synapomorphies:
• Hair
• Mammary glands
(don’t fossilize well)
Three skeletal characteristics (fossilize)
• Lower jaw only one bone, the dentary (several in reptiles)
• Three bones in middle ear: malleus, incus, stapes (reptiles have one or two, never three)
• Joint between upper and lower jaws between dentary and squamosal of skull (in reptiles
this joint is between other bones)
Mammals basically have a synapsid skull design inherited from ancestor
Non diagnostic characteristics (not unique to mammals):
• Warm-blooded
• Skin glands: sweat glands and oil-producing sebaceous glands
• Large nasal cavities (because of high metabolism) Clean, warm and humidify air
• Heterodonty (diﬀerentiated teeth)
• Diphiodonty: two sets of teeth: baby and adult (“deciduous” teeth, drop out) (reptile
teeth are continually replaced)
Subclass Protheria
monotremes (Greek mon-, one; and trema, hole), or egg-laying mammals, have one opening
for excretion and urination.
132Subphylum Vertebrata
Subclass Theria
Metatheria: Marsupials (opossum, kangaroo...) Eutheria: Placental mammals (all common
mammals)
Marsupium: (from Greek marsypion, purse or pouch). Gestation period much shorter than
in Eutherian mammals, but after leaving the uterus the tiny oﬀspring crawls into a pouch
where it completes development latched onto a teat.
Recent molecular (read: genetic) evidence suggests that two diﬀerent mammal groups
may have developed live-bearing ability separately. Instead of being a “rough draft” for
placental-style live bearing, perhaps the marsupial pouch approach is another solution to
the same problem. Advantage: in tough times the parent can pitch out the oﬀspring and
increase its own chance of survival.
13325 Tissues and Systems
13526 Epithelial tissue
Comes from various sources, ectodermal or endodermal material. Cell sheet lines a
surface or body cavity. One side, called freesurface or Apical, is exposed to
• animal interior (forming the lumen) or
• exterior of its body cavity.
The other side rests on the basal layer.
Epithelial tissue is not penetrated by blood vessels.
Two categories:
• sheets
• glands
Classiﬁed on two features:
• simple, (a single layer of cells),
• stratiﬁed, (more than one cell layer.)
Cell shape at free surface:
• squamous (broad and ﬂat)
• cuboidal (spherish)
• columnar (tall and thin)
Simple squamous epithelium
usually lines body cavities and vessels,alveoli, glomeruli of kidney; in blood and lymph
vessels called endothelium; in body cavities called mesothelium (serosae): parietal serous
membranes line body wall, visceral serous membranes cover organ
Simple cuboidal epithelium
in ducts like kidney and salivary glands.
Simple columnar epithelium
nonciliated type lines digestive tract, ciliated type lines some regions of uterine tubes and
lungs
Stratiﬁed squamous epithelium
(important) lines mouth, esophagus,and vagina. Cells sometimes dead, ﬂat and keratinized,
making them resistant to abrasion. Stratiﬁed squamous epithelium changes to columnar
squamous epithelium progressively down esophagus to the stomach.
Epidermis
137Epithelial tissue
from epithelium. Below this is dermis, thicker and with blood vessels.
Two specialized epithelia:
• pseudostratiﬁed
• transitional
Pseudostratiﬁed epithelia
lines the trachea (where it is ciliated)and the male urethra (where it is non ciliated), looks
stratiﬁed but not.
Transitional epithelia
found only in bladder and urinary system. As it stretches it appears to go from 6 to 3 cell
layers deep.
Glandular epithelia
(gland: group of cells that excretes something.. mostly derived from epithelium. Glands
are classiﬁed into endocrine and exocrine by where they excrete.
Endocrine glands
secrete hormones into the blood without use of ducts.
Exocrine glands
secrete onto the body surface or into a cavity, thru a duct. Exocrine substances include
sweat, mucous, oil, and saliva. An exocrine gland is the liver, which secretes bile.
13827 Connective tissue
This is a “grab bag” category of diverse tissue types. Functions include binding and
supporting. Types include bone, cartilage, ﬁbrous connective tissue, blood and
adipose (fat) tissue.
If you took away everything in the body except the connective tissue, you’d still be able to
see the basic form of the body.
Form: distinctivecellssurroundedbyacellmatrixmadeofextra-cellularﬁbergrounded
in a ground substance (excluding blood)
Types:
1. connectile connective tissues (can be 1. loose or 2. dense)
2. special connective tissue (includes blood, bones and cartilage).
Fibroblasts form connective tissue proper;
chondoroblasts form cartilage;
osteoblasts form bone;
and blood is formed from various sources.
Ground substance: “unstructured” material that ﬁlls space between cells and contains
ﬁbers. Made of
1. interstitial ﬂuid (bathes cells)
2. proteoglycans (protein core with attached polysaccharides, glycoaminoglycans or GAGs
such as chondroitin sulfate, keratin sulfate, and hyalronic acid, whose consistency is syrupy
to gelatin-like)
3. cell-adhesion proteins (connect connective tissue cells to the ﬁbers).
Fibers of connective tissue:
139Connective tissue
1. Collagen (ﬂexible protein resistant to stretching, tensile strength, most abundant
protein in animals, white)
2. elastin (rubbery, resilient protein, in dermis, lungs, blood vessels, yellow when fresh)
3. andreticulin (like collagen).
Loose connective tissue: found beneath skin, anchors muscles,nerves etc. Include ﬁ-
broblasts, macrophages, mast cells,and adipose cells. Fibers include collagen and
elastic ﬁbers. Ground substance is “syrupy”. Adipose included.
Dense connective tissue: largely densely packed ﬁbers of collagen or elastin regularly
or irregularly arranged. Forms tendons and ligaments, coverings of muscles, capsules
around organs and joints, and dermis of skin.
Cartilage vs. bone
Feature Bone Cartilage
cell type osteocytes chondrocytes
ground substance calcium phosphate chondroitin sulfate
vascularization vascular avascular
micro architecture highly ordered less organized
units called osteons
ﬁbrous sheath peristeum perichondrium
Cartilage: There are three cartilage types:
1. hyaline cartilage
2. ﬁbrocartilage (ﬁbrous cartilage)
3. elastic cartilage
Hyaline cartilage: most widespread cartilage type, in adults forms articular surfaces of
long bones, rib tips, rings of trachea, and parts of skull. Mostly collagen, name refers to
glassy appearance. In embryo, bones form ﬁrst as hyaline cartilage, later ossiﬁes. Found
in tracheal rings. Few collagen ﬁbers.
Fibrous cartilage: have lots of collagen ﬁbers. Found in intervertebral discs, pubic
symphesis. Grades into dense tendon and ligament tissue.
Elastic cartilage: springy and elastic. Found in internal support of external ear and in
epiglottis, yellow when fresh.
Chondrocites (cartilage cells) rely on diﬀusion for nutrients, as cartilage has no direct
blood supply, and no enervation (nerves). Can be loaded with calcium salts.
140Subphylum Vertebrata
Bone: Specialized connective tissue, calcium phosphate arranged in highly ordered unit
called osteon, or Hyvercian system. Concentric rings around central canal with blood
vessels and enervation (nerves). Bone varied, not all vertebrate bone is even cellular. Our
concern: simple pattern for mammals.
Lacuna (spaces in which osteocytes found); canaliculi (little canals) bigger diagonal cells,
layers of bone called lamellae.
Three types of bone cells, ending in
-blast, (mend bone)
-cyte (fortify bone)
-clast (tear down bone)
Classiﬁed by
1. appearance (spongy vs. hard)
2. where found (outside or inside)
3. how it is formed (endochondral cartilage model forms ﬁrst and then is ossiﬁed, and
entramembranous, bone forms directly without cartilage precursor)
Example of endochondral bone formation: long bone begins to ossify from center shaft,
calciﬁed region expands and cuts oﬀ diﬀusion of nutrients as bone replaces cartilage. In
young mammals, secondary ossiﬁcation centers then form at bone ends, growth has stopped
by sexual maturity as all primary bone is ossiﬁed. In other animals, bones continue growing
throughout their lifetime.
Three types of intramembrous bone:
1. dermal bone
2. sessamoid bone
3. perichondral bone.
Dermal bone forms skull, shoulder/pectoral girdle, and integument, descended from dermal
armor of ancestor. Comes from mesoderm, in dermis of skin.
Sessamoid bones: form directly in tendons. Example: kneecap, also in wrist. Deals with
stress.
Perichondral bone means “around cartilage,” forms around cartilage or bone. Func-
tions in bone repair and in ossiﬁcation of endochondral bone.
141Connective tissue
Bone remodeling and repair: bone has mineral structure, and develops tiny fractures,
which, under stress, can lead to larger fractures. To combat this, bone is constantly replaced.
Osteoclasts channel through existing bone, tear down and leave behind osteoblasts
and lacuna, leaving osteocytes. Continually resets mineral structure of bone, and is
preventative maintenance.
When bone broken, callus forms in open ends, periosteum gives rise to new bone with
calcium and new bone matrix, leaves irregular mend. Later, osteoblasts continue ﬁxing over
time and slowly removing imperfection.
14228 Muscle tissue
Mesodermal in origin, muscle has several functions: supply force for movement,restrain
movement, proper posture, act on viscera (internal organs) for peristalsis (moving food
down digestive tract), give body shape, form sphincters, (such as in esophagus, between
stomach and intestine, large and small intestine, in anus), in sheets of muscles, aﬀect air
ﬂow in and out of lungs, line blood vessels and play vital role in circulation.
Secondary roles: heat production (shivering a specialized heat production to supplement
metabolism).
Muscles co-opted to other non-original functions: sharks detect electrical ﬁeld created by ﬁsh
muscles. Some ﬁsh formed electric organs, create current strong enough to repel predators
or stun prey. Other ﬁsh can use ﬁeld as “radar” to see things and communicate with other
animals. (Evolved independently in diﬀerent groups).
Diﬀerent classiﬁcations: by color, (red or white) location, nature of nervous system
control (voluntary or involuntary), embryonic origin, or by general microscopic ap-
pearance (striated, smooth, and cardiac.)
Striated muscle (or skeletal muscle): under voluntary control. Individual cells called
ﬁbers, grouped into fascicle. Myoﬁbrils founding one cell made of even smaller myoﬁl-
aments. Each striated cell very long and multi-nucleated. Fibers joined end to end to
form longer composite ﬁbers. Sarcomeres: repeating units make up myoﬁbrils. Two
kinds of myoﬁlaments, thick kind made up of myosin and thin of actin. Striations visible
in light microscope, smaller part only with electron microscope.
Cardiac muscle: occurs only in heart. Light banding visible under light microscope.
Each band short, principally mononucleate (occasionally dinucleate) often branched, joined
together with intercollated discs. Involuntary. Waves of contraction spread through intercol-
lated discs. Initiated by nerve stimulation or can originate in the heart itself (useful in heart
transplants.)
Smooth muscle: no striations visible with light microscope. Almost entirely visceral
function: digestion, sphincters, urogenital tracts, piloerectory muscles (make hairs stand up),
lungs. Non-voluntary control. Slow and sustained action. Each cell mononucleate, short,
fusiform (spindly) in shape, cells usually uniform in size.
Striated muscle contraction: Muscle broken into units called fascicles, in units of myoﬁbrils.
Repeating units called sarcomeres, consisting of two kinds of myoﬁlaments:
1. thick, myosin ﬁlament
2. thin, actin ﬁlament.
143Muscle tissue
Sarcomere: Thick and thin ﬁlaments interspersed in ordered grid.
Sliding ﬁlament theory: thick and thin ﬁlaments move past each other in opposite
direction, shortening length. Longer muscles contract more rapidly than short ones (see cell
bio for details).
Myosin molecule: two polypeptides twisted together with two globular heads at end.
Myosin ﬁlament: many slender myosin molecules together.
Actin ﬁlament: chain of actin single, tropomyosin strands with repeated globular
troponin, and with actin. All play role in muscle contraction. Myocin heads have sites
that bind to actin. Actin ﬁlaments have many regular sites that can bind to myosin.
Troponin has four sites:
1. one to bind myosin
2. one for actin
3. one for tropomyocin
4. one for calcium ions
Nerve signal reaches muscle, triggers release of chemical signal called neurotransmitter,
that diﬀuses across cell membrane (sarcolimic reticulum) and binds to receptors in it.
Receptor is acetylcholine, ACH. When there is enough nerve signal, the message travels
through t-line to sarcoplasmic reticulum to release calcium ions.
Lacking calcium, tropomyosin site blocked. In calcium, myosin binding sites exposed and
heads bind to actin molecules, delivering force to move ﬁbers in relation to each other.
Myocin head then interacts with ATP to get “recocked”, if myosin still exposed then it
ﬁres again and results in further muscle contration. If there is no further nerve signal,
sarcoplasmic reticulum sequesters Ca+ ions again and no recocking occurs.
Quirari (or curare): known from movies, used in South America, blocks acetylcholine
receptors in cell and causes skeletal paralysis. Victim dies of asphyxiation because he can’t
breathe.
Duchenne's muscular dystrophy: degeneration of sarcolema, plasma membrane of
muscle cell unable to release signal and quickly atrophies.
Fast and slow twitch ﬁbers: vertebrate muscle ﬁber. Terms relative within one group
of animals. Diﬀerences related to diﬀerences in enervation, type of myocin, and actin
activation.
Two parts of force generated by muscle: 1. active component 2. elastic component (energy
stored in muscle when stretched by gravity or another force. Stored in muscle elastic tissue
around tendons. Especially important in limb oscillation, like running, or trunk twisting,
like ﬁsh swimming. Up to 90% of stored elastic energy can be recovered.)
144Subphylum Vertebrata
How does a muscle match its power to its job? Two ways:
1. rate modulation, derived from frequency of nervous stimulation of muscle, force
increases as frequency of stimulation increases up to point of tetanus.
2. selective involvement of motor units, a given neuron enervates a ﬁxed number of
muscle cells, (a motor unit), and force is increased by recruiting more motor units. Motor
units may be small, such as in eye, or larger, like in leg muscle.
How do muscles grow stronger?
1. add more myoﬁlaments, increases cross sectional area by up to 50%, more little ratchets
working
2. proliferation in blood vessels and connective tissue around muscle
Muscle strength is relative to cross sectional area, not length. Not always feasible to add
more cross sectional area.
Pinnate ﬁbers: oriented obliquely (Y-shaped) to minimize muscle mass, in certain circum-
stances, like calf muscle. Spreads muscle out.
Velocity of shortening greater in long muscle than short. Why? Contraction tied to relation
between ﬁbers, and to total length of muscle. Both long and short muscles reach same
percentage of contraction in same unit time, but distance covered by the longer muscle is
greater.
Synergist muscles: muscles work together to produce motion in same general direction.
Bicep shares work with brachialis.
Antagonist muscles: muscles that oppose each other. Bicep pulls forearm in, triceps pulls
it back out.
Origin vs. insertion: origin is the end of the muscle that more ﬁxed in its attachment to
the body. The more movable end called insertion.
Fixators: muscles that act to stabilize a joint or lever system. Like upper arm when you
clench your ﬁst hard.
Flexors and extensors: applied mainly to limbs. Flexor bends one part relative to another
about limb, extensor straightens it.
Adductor and abductor: adductor draws a limb toward the ventral surface. Abductor
moves limb away from ventral surface. (Adduct: drawn toward; abduct: carry away).
14529 Vertebrate digestive system
Functions to break down food into molecules small enough to absorb, or pass across digestive
membrane.
Digestive tract: tube extending from lips of mouth to anus or cloacae in bird, reptile or
monotreme.
Lumanal glands: empty into inner body cavity (lumen: inner surface).
Tract divided into three main regions: 1. buccal cavity 2. pharynx 3. alimentary canal
Alimentary canal divided into four regions: 1. esophagus 2. stomach 3. small intestine 4.
large intestine
Accessory digestive glands, outside digestive tract proper, secrete into lumen of tract
through ducts. Includes the salivary glands, liver and pancreas.
Buccalcavity, whichincludespalateandtongue, developsfrominfoldingofstomadeum,
or second opening of blastula, whereas the rest of the digestive tract develops from the
primitive gut.
Teeth: capture and hold prey. In mammals in particular further process and break down
food into small particles, increasing surface area available for enzymatic action.
Tooth anatomy: 1. crown projects above gum, 2. root below gum, 3. enamel is outer
coating of crown, hardest surface in body, of epideral origin 4. dentin, below enamel,
bone-like and forms bulk of tooth, is harder than bone and contains nerves and blood vessels.
(Remember that mammals are heterodontic, with diﬀerent types of teeth).
Pharynx: air passage for adult, gill slits in embryo. Important in lower vertebrates, site of
gills. Features derived from pharyngeal region: ﬁrst pharyngeal pouch gives rise to parts
of the ear, other pouches give rise to various other structures.
Alimentary canal: epithelium lines lumen, glands secrete into lumen, longitudinal and
circular muscles help digestive movements (peristalsis).
Esophagus: tube carries food from mouth to stomach. Expands to ﬁt large bolus (lump
of chewed food). Secretes mucus for lubrication. Birds have crop for storage, enlargement
of esophagus.
Epiglottis: keeps food out of air tube, an evolutionary “kludge,” or ﬁx.
Stomach. Absorbs water, alcohol, nutrients, uses gastric juice with enzymes, mucous, HCl,
released by chief and parietal cells (release protein enzymes) in gastric pits. Rugae: folds
of stomach, disappear when full. Sphincter at both ends of stomach, control food passage.
Chyme: semi-digested food released to small intestine.
147Vertebrate digestive system
Small intestine: three regions, duodenum, jejunum, and ileum.
Duodenum site of most intestinal digestion. Jejunum and ileum do most of intestinal
absorption. Ileum ends with another sphincter, ileocolic valve or ileosecal valve. Structure:
Circular folds covered with villi (singular is villus).
Villi: ﬁnger-likecellular projections, covered withmicrovilli, tinyprojectionswhichincrease
surfacearea. Increasessurfaceareaby900x, speedsdigestion(breakdown)andabsorption
(taking in nutrients).
Large intestine: larger diameter, shorter length than small intestine. No villi. In mammals,
forms large gentle loop, colon, empties into straight region, rectum, empties into outside
world through anal sphincter. Colon: absorbs water left over, also absorbs vitamins released
by bacteria which live there (vitamin K).
Food: made up of 1. proteins, 2. fats, 3. carbohydrates 4. ﬁbrous material.
Digestive system breaks foods down. Proteins must be broken to amino acids to be
absorbed. Polysaccharides to monosaccharides, lipids to fatty acids and monoglyc-
erides to absorb.
Salivary glands in mouth, saliva contains mucous, salt and a few enzymes (amalase, begins
starch breakdown). Snake venom from oral gland, mixture of toxins and digestive enzymes.
Breaks down blood vessels and disables nervous system.
Stomach enzymes: released in inactive form, zymogene, converts to active form in lumen
of gut. Transformation is triggered by another enzyme, or the stomach’s low pH. Pepsin
secreted as pepsinogen (-ogen means primitive form). Stomach glands secrete up to two or
three liters a day of gastric juice, which is reabsorbed.
Chyme released to duodenum.
Small intestine has two major accessory glands: 1. pancreas 2. liver
Pancreas has endocrine and exocrine functions, releases large amounts of carbonate to
neutralize acidic chyme, as intestinal enzymes work in neutral pH, and stuﬀ to break down
lipids and starch (zymogens, like tripsin)
Liver releases bile. Bile made from cholesterol, stored in gall bladder, released in
duodenum, emulsiﬁes fats.
Emulsify: keeps fats in tiny drops, which are suspended, increasing surface area and action
of lipases. Protein and carbohydrates absorbed in intestine, taken to liver for processing.
Fatty acids go to lymphatic system
Appendix: vestigial remnant. Much variation in digestive systems within mammals:
herbivore, carnivore, insectivore, non-ruminant herbivore.
Rumen: four-chambered stomach of animals like cows (ruminant herbivores). Cellulose
resistant to digestion, rely on microorganisms to break down cellulose. Some bacteria,
protists and fungi can break down cellulose, almost no animals can. Bacteria break down
cellulose in rumen, to be taken back to the mouth to chew their cud (ruminate). Later cow
swallows to proceed with digestion. (Horses not like this).
148Subphylum Vertebrata
Coprophagy: rabbits and other animals eat their own feces for the nutritious products of
the cecum.
14930 Circulatory system
Circulatory system functions
1. Transportation
a. Respiration: gas exchange (O2 and CO2), overcomes limited rate
of
diﬀusion
b. Nutrition:<br>
c. Excretory: (remove metabolic wastes)<br>
2. Regulation
a. Transport hormones<br>
b. Regulate body temperature<br>
c. Protection<br>
i. Blood clotting<br>
ii. Immune system (carries white blood cells)
Vasodilation: allows heat loss across epidermis, as seen in elephant ears, takes more blood
to surface of body, sweating may accompany
Countercurrent heat exchange: used by dolphins in ﬁns to conserve heat in cold water.
Veins surround an artery, and blood returning to body absorbs heat from blood traveling
out from body to ﬁn, minimizing heat loss. Used by dogs in feet, etc.
Blood made of 1. plasma and 2. formed cellular elements (red and white blood cells,
and platelets).
Plasma makes up 55% of blood volume. Cellular elements make up the other 45%.
Plasma makeup: 90% water, 7-8% soluble proteins (albumin maintains blood osmotic
integrity, others clot, etc.) 1% electrolytes 1% elements in transit
Red blood cell (erythrocyte): contains hemoglobin, functions in oxygen transport. In
mammals, red blood cells lose nuclei on maturation, and take on biconcave, dimpled, shape.
No self repair, live 120 days. About 1000x more red blood cells than white blood cells.
About 7-8 micrometers in diameter.
151Circulatory system
Hematocrit: proportion of blood volume that is occupied by cells, about 43% in humans
on average. 48% for men and 38% for women.
White blood cells (leukocytes): Nucleated, about 10-14 micrometers in diameter, com-
monly amoeboid, escape circulatory system in capillary beds. Include basophils, eosinophils,
neutrophils, monocytes, B- and T-cell lymphocytes.
Platelets (thrombocytes) Membrane bound cell fragments in mammals, no nucleus. In
non-mammals, platelet role replaced by nucleated cells. Accumulate at site of broken blood
vessels, form clots. Bud oﬀ special cells in bone marrow. 1-2 micrometers in diameter. 7-8
day life span, 1/10 or 1/20 as abundant as white blood cells.
Arteries: carry blood away from heart. Smallest tubes called arterioles, feed blood to
capillaries.
Veins: return blood to heart. Smallest veins called venules.
Structure of arteries and veins, listed from inside (lumen) out: 1. epithelium (endothelium),
2. elastic connective tissue ﬁbers, 3. smooth muscle, 4. connective tissue. Arteries
have thicker elastic layer than do veins.
Capillaries, where exchange of materials occurs, are very thin and narrow, and red blood
cells pass through single ﬁle. Capillaries are tiny but numerous, and their total volume is
greater than that of supplying arteries.
Blood velocity drops in capillaries, picks back up in veins. Pressure highest in arteries, lower
in capillaries and arteries.
Osmotic pressure draws interstitial ﬂuid from blood in arterioles, but replaces it in venules.
One-way valves mean that blood can ﬂow only one way, works with residual blood pressure
and compression by skeletal muscles. Low pressure in thoracic cavity caused by breathing
also helps move blood.
Lymphatic system: part of the immune system, a one-way, or open, system. Takes up
interstitial ﬂuid not taken up by venules.
Lymphatic structures:
1. lymphatic capillaries
2. lymphatic vesicles
3. lymph nodes
4. lymphatic organs (spleen and thymus)
Lymph: movement in mammals through one-way valves, similar to blood movement in
veins. (Some non-mammals have lymphatic hearts of unknown embryonic origin. Frogs and
salamanders have several.) Lymph rejoins cardiovascular system into a large vein near the
heart via single large thoracic duct.
152Subphylum Vertebrata
As lymph passes through system, passes lymphocytes, second part of immune system.
Heart: pumps blood, design varies between animals. In adult mammal,four chambers form
two separate circulations
1. pulmonary circulation to and from lungs and
2. systemic circulation to and from tissues of body.
Everything in the heart comes in pairs: 2 atria, 2 ventricles (left and right).
Diagrams usually drawn as though animal were on its back.
Pattern of blood ﬂow through heart: blood returning from major veins (vena cava)
enters rightatrium, contraction there delivers blood to rightventricle through atricuspid
valve, one of atrial ventricular valves (AV valve). Contraction of right ventricle drives blood
through semi lunar valve into pulmonary circuit and to lungs.Blood return to heart in
pulmonary veins, is oxygenated. Goes to left atrium, which contracts and delivers blood
to left ventricleby way of aortic semi-lunar valve, then goes to systemic circulation.
Both atria and ventricles contract in unison, left is more powerful than right (to all system
vs. just lungs).
Systole: heart contraction, diastole: heart relaxed
Timing of heart contraction: ventricles rebound to relaxed shape (diastole), and semi-
lunar valves close. Both atria(singular: atrium) ﬁll with blood coming from pulmonary
and systemic circulations.Pressure rises in the atria and blood begins to move into the
ventricles.The atria then contract, forcing more blood into the ventricles. There is a pause,
then ventricles contract. This raises ventricle pressure, atrio-ventricular(AV) valves
shut and semi-lunar valves open, forcing blood from the left ventricle into the major arteries
and from the right ventricle into the aorta.
Control for this action doesn’t rely on nervous stimulation, has intrinsic rhythmicity, called
myogenic. This is the case in mammal as well as in mollusk hearts. Other animals have
neurogenic hearts that rely on nervous stimulation for heart action, originating in the
cardiac ganglion.
The rhythmicity of mammalian heart relies on the sino-atrial (SA)node, or pacemaker.
This is a phylogenic (based on evolutionary history) remnant of an early vertebrate heart
that had one more chamber than modern hearts.
How the heart contracts: waves of depolarization start in SA node and spread
through atria. Connectile tissue pauses the spread of depolarization at the atrial ventricular
node. Signal continued by bundle branches to lower ventricle, begins to stimulate
heart to contract. Contraction starts at bottom of heart at heart apex,then signals spread
through heart.
Medulla (in the brain) controls autonomic nervous system. (The medulla is part of
the brain, is continuous with the spinal cord, and controls involuntary actions of the
body). Sympatheticcardiacacceleratorconnectstospinalcord, usesnorepinephrine
to signal. Parasympathetic cardio-inhibitory center reaches heart through Vagus
153Circulatory system
nerve, usesacetylcholine to signal. Hyperpolarizes membrane to inhibit heart contraction.
(Autonomic nervous system: two parts working in contra to control from both sides.)
Dominant eﬀect here is inhibitory. If we cut Vagus nerve, heart rate promptly rises about
25 bpm.
15431 Respiratory system
In humans and other animals, for example, the anatomical features of the respiratory system
include airways, lungs, and the respiratory muscles.
Other animals, such as insects, have respiratory systems with very simple anatomical features,
and in amphibians even the skin plays a vital role in gas exchange.
Plants also have respiratory systems but the directionality of gas exchange can be opposite
to that in animals. The respiratory system in plants also includes anatomical features such
as holes on the undersides of leaves known as stomata.
In mammals, the diaphragm divides the body cavity into the
abdominal cavity: contains the viscera (e.g., stomach and intestines)
thoracic cavity: contains the heart and lungs.
Respiratory tree: terminates in alveolus, alveoli. Respiratory bronchioles branch into
alveolar ducts and into alveoli. Alveolus: microscopic air sacs, 300 million of these in human
lungs. Total surface area large. Gas diﬀuses micrometer, very tiny distance.
Nervous System
Composed of tissues designed to integrate sensory information and direct a coordinated
response to the environment.
1
Basic unit of the nervous system is the neuron , a highly specialized cell that uses both
electrical and chemical processes to communicate. Neurons "listen" to sensory organs or
other neurons, and can simultaneously "hear" from 1 to hundreds of inputs simultaneously.
Likewise, a neuron can "talk" to other neurons or cells that can create an action, like muscle
cells or glands.
Neurons are outnumbered in the nervous system by glia. Glia were once thought to only play
a supportive role in helping neurons survive; today we know that they also are important
participants in the communication process. Glial cells include astrocytes, ependymal cells,
and a cell that has a macrophage like function. There are also oligodendocytes and Schwann
cells that provide a myelin sheath.

155Respiratory system
31.1 Neuron structure
Figure 9 Neuron
• Dendrite will receive information from other axons
• Stoma is the neuron body and contains typical cell parts including the mitochondria and
nucleus. This is where neurotransmitters are synthesized.
• Axon hillock is where the cell body and the axon meet.
• Axon is surrounded by myelin.
• Contains nodes of Ranvier
Types of axons include unipolar, bipolar, pseudopolar.
Action potentials results from excitatory stimuli received from the dendrites that results
in a signal that travels down the axon. On the cellular level, there is a Na+ inﬂux via
channels causing a depolarization of the cell. Once those channels close, the slower opening
K+ channels will open resulting in hyperpolarization by the cell.
Synapses
Neurotransmitters allow a chemical signal to be sent from one neuron to the other. Neuro-
transmitters must bypass a physical gap called the synapse. Examples of neurotransmitters
include acetylcholine, epinephrine, and glutamate.
Example : Neuromuscular synapses
156Central nervous system
Circuits / Nuclei / Ganglia
31.2 Central nervous system
Central nervous system includes the brain and the spinal cord.
Brain There are four lobes of the brain.
• Frontal lobe - decision making
• Parietal lobe
• Temporal lobe
• Occipital lobe - vision
The areas of the brain are also dedicated to diﬀerent functions.
• Precentral gyrus
• Postcentral gyrus
Protection The CNS is protected by three layers - the pia mater, the arachnoid mater, and
the dura mater. Protection also comes from the circulation of cerebral spinal ﬂuid (CSF).
CSF helps to ﬂoat the brain and also provide nutrients to both the brain and the spinal
cord. CSF is synthesized from the choroid plexus of the lateral ventricles. In total, there are
four ventricles - 2 lateral ventricles, a 3rd, and 4th ventricle.
31.3 Peripheral nervous system
The peripheral nervous system is broken down into two sub-systems, the somatic nervous
system and the autonomic nervous system.
ANS - Autonomic Nervous System The ANS has two components - parasympathetic and
sympathetic.
The sympathetic nervous system is the "ﬁght or ﬂight" or fright response and results in an
increased heart rate, increased rate of breathing, and an elevated blood glucose level. There
is also decreased digestion. The second neurotransmitter is epinephrine. In this case, the
ﬁrst neuron is short and the second neuron is long.
The parasympathetic nervous system is the rest and digest system.
Drugs must be able to pass the blood brain barrier to have an eﬀect on the CNS. Drugs act
by aﬀecting the neuron and how likely it is to ﬁre an action potential.
Stroke occurs when there is a blood clot that goes to the brain and prevent blood ﬂow.
15732 Sensory systems
Categorized by
1. nature of stimulus, such as mechanical, chemicalor light stimulus, and
2. where stimulus received, such as outside (exteroceptors,such as the eye and
skin temp receptors) or insidebody (interoceptors, such as blood body tem-
perature receptors).
Transduction of sensory input into signal. Means to “carry across”,signal transduced, or
carried, from environment into nervous signal.
Three sensory processes we cover
1. taste and smell (chemoreception)
2. gravity and movement
3. light
32.1 Taste and smell (chemoreception)
Found in mammal nose and mouth, ﬂy feet, ﬁsh bodies, moth antennae.
Papilla: bumps on tongue, contain taste buds down between. Sweet, sour, salty and bitter.
Some act directly by ion channels, others act indirectly. Other “taste” sensations really
smell.
Smell: received in nasopharynx. Airborne molecules go into solution on moist epithelial
surface of nasal passage. Approximately 1000 genescode for sensory neuron receptors. “Fried
onions” odor not one receptor but a mixture of many odors registered in our mind as one.
Very sensitive, habituates rapidly (don’t notice a smell after a bit). Odor sensation has
relatively unﬁltered root to higher brain centers.
Snakes more chemosensory focused than us.
32.2 Response to gravity and movement
Registered in inner ear. Three semicircular canals loop in three planes at right angles
to each other, responsible for transduction of movement messages. Method: hair cells
159Sensory systems
deformed by gelatinous membrane. Vestibular apparatus, gives us perception of gravity
and movement. Due to physical response, not chemical binding.
Cochlea: bony, coil shaped part of inner ear, where hearing occurs.
Sound enters throughauditory canal, vibratestympanic membrane,moving three bones
of middle ear (malleus, incus, and stapes)against oval window opening in front of cochlea.
Cochlea has three ﬂuid ﬁlled ducts, one of these the organ of Corti. Sound waves in air
go to vibration in organ of Corti; ﬂuid tickles hair cells, which register the movement
along basilar membrane in cochlea. Diﬀerent sound frequencies move diﬀerent portions
of basilar membrane. Hearing loss due to loss of hair cells.Humans normally smell more
than 300 odors in a day(Facts and Truth).
Transduction of sound accomplished throgh physical deformation,not chemical binding.
32.3 Vision
Light enters pupil, focused by lensonto retina.
Sclera: hardened part behind retina.
Optic nerves and neurons attached to retina. Blind spot where optic nerve attaches, has
no receptors.
Two types of photoreceptors
1. rods - black and white low-light vision, 100 million in each retina in humans.
2. cones - color vision, work best under better illumination. 3 million in each retina.
Fovia: region of most acute vision, has most of the cones, few rods.
Transduction process of light to signal a molecular change, to light absorbing molecule
called photopigment. Located in outer parts of rods and cones in pigment discs. The rod
photopigment is called rhodopsin,cone has three photopigments, called photopsins. This
molecular change initiates pathways to result in action potential in downstream neuron
leading to vision center in brain.Parul Godika
Each of the three photopsins has a diﬀerent peak of sensitivity: blue,green or red, and
changes isometric form (from cisto trans) based on light from a particular wavelength
range. Color blindness:inherited lack of one or more types of these cones. Gene carried on X
chromosome, therefore more common in men than women.
32.4 Homeostasis
Is a very important part of everyone's and everything's lives. Deﬁned as dynamic con-
stancy of internal environment, maintenance of a relatively stable environment inside
an organism usually involving feedback regulation.
160Osmotic environments and regulations
Homeostasis is maintained in face of
1. a varying external environment, or
2. a non-ideal, constant external environment (as with the penguin).
Deals with temperature, pH, chemical concentrations,pressure, oxygen levels.
Occurs through negative feedback loops.
Various forms: simple thermostat in house turns oﬀ heater when above a certain temperature
and on when below a certain temperature Involves stimulus, sensor,integrating center,
eﬀector and response.
More eﬃcient control has two sensors and two eﬀectors. Can be antagonistic to each
other, such as, one cools, the other heats.
Precise control through proportional control, not all-or-none, furnace comes on a little
bit if the house a bit cold. Examples in humans: vasoconstriction, change in metabolic rate,
shivering. Physiological responses for high body temp: blood goes to body surface, sweating,
behavioral changes (get out of sun).
Positive feedback loop: eﬀector increases deviation from set point. Ampliﬁes reaction.
Like blood clotting process, uterine contraction during childbirth. Negative feedback must
exist at some point for control.
32.5 Osmotic environments and regulations
1. Marine invertebrates
a) fully marine invertebrates (not intertidal or estuarine) osmoconformers (set
internal environment same as environment, no net ﬂow of ions) in a stenohaline
(narrow non-changing salt level) environment
b) Coastal, intertidal, estuarine (ion levels ﬂuctuate) invertebrates.Partly osmo-
confomers, partly osmoregulators in a euryhaline (wide salt level variation)
environment (ex: shore crab, regulates sometimes when salt levels in environment
get real low).
2. Freshwater animals. Here, environment has lower solute concentrations than do
living organisms so water tends to ﬂow in and solutes out.
a) Freshwater ﬁsh (bony) dilute urine, and gills actively take up ions (NaCl)
b) Freshwater invertebrates: same situation as freshwater ﬁsh but with diﬀerent
structures
c) Freshwater amphibians: active uptake of salts across their skin
3. Marine ﬁshes: Here the environment has a higher solute concentration than does
the organism so water tends to ﬂow out and ions in.
a) Bony ﬁshes: actively secrete salts (NaCl) across gills, absorb water across gut
wall, their kidney (unlike mammalian kidney) is unable to generate concentrated
urine so glomerulus is reduced, active tubular secretion of MgSO
4
b) cartilaginous ﬁshes (and coelacanth): blood retains urea and trimethylamineoxide
to increase its osmolality to that of seawater
161Sensory systems
4. Terrestrial animals: here problem is loss of water to a drier environment, and
regulation of salt levels.
a) water loss adaptations
b) concentrated exception of salts and nitrogenous wastes
Hypoosmotic: having less osmotic potential than nearby ﬂuid
Hyperosmotic: having more osmotic potential than nearby ﬂuid
Isoosmotic: having equal osmotic potential than nearby ﬂuid
Glomerulus: reduces volume of kidney
Fish started in salt water, spread to fresh water, later reinvaded salt-water environment.
Terrestrial animal water sources:
1. drinking
2. moist foods
3. from breakdown of metabolic molecules like fats. (Desert kangaroo rats get 90% of their
water from metabolism.)
Secretion of nitrogenous wastes: from metabolism of amino acids, amino group has to be
removed in one of three basically interchangeable chemical forms:
1. ammonia (aquatic life)
2. urea (mammals)
3. uric acid (birds)
Ammonia very toxic, soluble, and cheap to produce. Easy to expel for bony ﬁshes.
Urea: low toxicity, good solubility, more costly to lose as it contains other groups on it.
Must be released in solution, water cost.
Uric acid (white part of bird poo) low toxicity, insoluble, secreted with little water loss,
more costly side groups lost than the others.
Mammalian kidney: Structure: ﬁst-sized organ in lower back. About 1/5 of blood from
aorta at any time is passing through kidneys. Blood passes through kidney many times a
day.
Nephron: structural and functional unit of kidney.
Bowmans capsule: funnel-like opening, contains primary ﬁlter, the glomerulus.
Proximal convoluted tubule: receives stuﬀ from Bowmans capsule.
Loop of Henle: descends and ascends.
162Osmotic environments and regulations
Vasa recta: capillaries that surround the Loop of Henle.
Glomerulus: main ﬁlter of the nephron, located within the Bowman's capsule
Kidney properties and processes important to its function
1. Active transport of solutes from one ﬂuid to another against a concentration gradient,
+
Na actively transported out of ﬁltrate by cells of the thick ascending loop of Henley into
the interstitial ﬂuid
2. Passive movement of solutes and water from one ﬂuid to another(down a concen-
tration gradient), movement of water and NaCl out of descending loop of Henley into
interstitial ﬂuid.
3. Diﬀerential permeability of cells in diﬀerent regions of the nephron to movement
of water and solutes, ascending thick look is impermeable to water, descending portion is
permeable to water
4. Hormonal control of that permeability, antidiuretic hormone(ADH) increases
permeability of collecting due to water, resulting in reduced volume of ﬁltrate and thus
more concentrated urine.
5. Increasing solute concentration in the interstitial ﬂuid of the kidney, from the
cortex to the deepest medulla, maintained by a countercurrent multiplier mechanism

11 Getting Started
32 Biology - The Life Science
The word biology means, "the science of life", from the Greek bios, life, and logos, word
or knowledge. Therefore, Biology is the science of Living Things. That is why Biology is
sometimes known as Life Science.
1
The science has been divided into many subdisciplines, such as botany , bacteriology,
2 3
anatomy , zoology, histology, mycology, embryology, parasitology, genetics , molecular biol-
4 5 6 7
ogy , systematics, immunology, microbiology , physiology, cell biology , cytology, ecology ,
and virology. Other branches of science include or are comprised in part of biology studies,
8
including paleontology , taxonomy, evolution, phycology, helimentology, protozoology, en-
tomology, biochemistry, biophysics, biomathematics, bio engineering, bio climatology and
anthropology.
2.1 Characteristics of life
Not all scientists agree on the deﬁnition of just what makes up life. Various characteristics
describe most living things. However, with most of the characteristics listed below we can
think of one or more examples that would seem to break the rule, with something nonliving
being classiﬁed as living or something living classiﬁed as nonliving. Therefore we are careful
not to be too dogmatic in our attempt to explain which things are living or nonliving.
• Living things are composed of matter structured in an orderly way where simple
molecules are ordered together into much larger macromolecules.
An easy way to remember this is GRIMNERD C All organisms; - Grow, Respire, Interact,
Move, Need Nutrients, Excrete (Waste), Reproduce,Death, Cells (Made of)
• Living things are sensitive, meaning they are able to respond to stimuli.
• Living things are able to grow, develop, and reproduce.
• Living things are able to adapt over time by the process of natural selection.
9
• All known living things use the hereditary molecule, DNA .

• Internal functions are coordinated and regulated so that the internal environment of a
10
living thing is relatively constant, referred to as homeostasis .
11
Living things are organized in the microscopic level from atoms up to cells . Atoms are
12 13
arranged into molecules, then into macromolecules , which make up organelles , which
work together to form cells. Beyond this, cells are organized in higher levels to form entire
14
multicellular organisms. Cells together form tissues , which make up organs, which are
part of organ systems, which work together to form an entire organism. Of course, beyond
this, organisms form populations which make up parts of an ecosystem. All of the Earth's
ecosystems together form the diverse environment that is the earth.
Example:-
sub atoms, atoms, molecules, cells, tissues, organs, organ systems, organisms, population,
community, eco systems
2.2 Nature of science
Science is a methodology for learning about the world. It involves the application
of knowledge.
The scientiﬁc method deals with systematic investigation, reproducible results, the
formation and testing of hypotheses, and reasoning.
Reasoning can be broken down into two categories, induction (speciﬁc data is used to
develop a generalized observation or conclusion) and deduction (general information leads
to speciﬁc conclusion). Most reasoning in science is done through induction.
Science as we now know it arose as a discipline in the 17th century.
2.3 Scientiﬁc method
The scientiﬁc method is not a step by step, linear process. It is an intuitive process, a
methodology for learning about the world through the application of knowledge. Scientists
must be able to have an "imaginative preconception" of what the truth is. Scientists will
often observe and then hypothesize the reason why a phenomenon occurred. They use all
of their knowledge and a bit of imagination, all in an attempt to uncover something that
might be true. A typical scientiﬁc investigation might go like so:
You observe that a room appears dark, and you ponder why the room is dark. In an attempt
to ﬁnd explanations to this curiosity, your mind unravels several diﬀerent hypotheses. One
hypothesis might state that the lights are turned oﬀ. Another hunch might be that the
room's lightbulb has burnt out. Worst yet, you could be going blind. To discover the truth,

6Scientiﬁc method
you experiment. You feel your way around the room and ﬁnd a light switch and turn it on.
No light. You repeat the experiment, ﬂicking the switch back and forth. Still nothing. That
means your initial hypothesis, the room is dark because the lights are oﬀ, has been rejected.
You devise more experiments to test your hypotheses, utilizing a ﬂashlight to prove that
you are indeed not blind. In order to accept your last remaining hypothesis as the truth,
you could predict that changing the light bulb will ﬁx the problem. If all your predictions
succeed, the original hypothesis is valid and is accepted. In some cases, however, your
predictions will not occur, in which you'll have to start over. Perhaps the power is oﬀ.
Figure 1 How Science is Done
A diagram that illustrates scientiﬁc investigation
Scientists ﬁrst make observations that raise a particular question. In order to explain the
observed phenomenon, they develop a number of possible explanations, or hypotheses. This
is the inductive part of science, observing and constructing plausible arguments for why

an event occurred. Experiments are then used to eliminate one of more of the possible
hypotheses until one hypothesis remains. Using deduction, scientists use the principles of
their hypothesis to make predictions, and then test to make sure that their predictions are
conﬁrmed. After many trials (repeatability) and all predictions have been conﬁrmed, the
hypothesis then may become a theory.
Quick Deﬁnitions
Observation - Quantitative and qualitative measurements of the world.
Inference - Deriving new knowledge based upon old knowledge.
Hypotheses - A suggested explanation.
Rejected Hypothesis - An explanation that has been ruled out through experimentation.
Accepted Hypothesis - An explanation that has not been ruled out through excessive
experimentation and makes veriﬁable predictions that are true.
Experiment - A test that is used to rule out a hypothesis or validate something already
known.
Scientiﬁc Method - The process of scientiﬁc investigation.
Theory - A widely accepted hypothesis that stands the test of time. Often tested, and
usually never rejected.
The scientiﬁc method is based primarily on the testing of hypotheses by experimentation.
This involves acontrol, or subject that does not undergo the process in question. A scientist
will also seek to limit variables to one or another very small number, single or minimum
number of variables. The procedure is to form a hypothesis or prediction about what you
believe or expect to see and then do everything you can to violate that, or falsify the
hypotheses. Although this may seem unintuitive, the process serves to establish more ﬁrmly
what is and what is not true.
A founding principle in science is a lack of absolute truth: the accepted explanation is the
most likely and is the basis for further hypotheses as well as for falsiﬁcation. All knowledge
has its relative uncertainty.
Theories are hypotheses which have withstood repeated attempts at falsiﬁcation. Common
theories include evolution by natural selection and the idea that all organisms consist of
cells. The scientiﬁc community asserts that much more evidence supports these two ideas
than contradicts them.
8Charles Darwin
2.4 Charles Darwin
Figure 2
Charles Darwin is most remembered today for his contribution of the theory of evolution
through natural selection.
The seeds of this theory were planted in Darwin's mind through observations made on a
ﬁve-year voyage through the New World on a ship called the Beagle. There, he studied
fossils and the geological record, geographic distribution of organisms, the uniqueness and
relatedness of island life forms, and the aﬃnity of island forms to mainland forms.
Upon his return to England, Darwin pondered over his observations and concluded that
evolution must occur through natural selection. He declined, however, to publish his work
because of its controversial nature. However, when another scientist, Wallace, reached similar
conclusions, Darwin was convinced to publish his observations in 1859. His hypothesis
revolutionized biology and has yet to be falsiﬁed by empirical data collected by mainstream
scientists.
2.5 After Darwin
Since Darwin's day, scientists have amassed a more complete fossil record, including
microorganisms and chemical fossils. These fossils have supported and added subtleties
to Darwin's theories. However, the age of the Earth is now held to be much older than
Darwin thought. Researchers have also uncovered some of the preliminary mysteries of
the mechanism of heredity as carried out through genetics and DNA, areas unknown to
Darwin. Another growing area is comparative anatomy including homology and analogy.
Today we can see a bit of evolutionary history in the development of embryos, as certain
(although not all) aspects of development recapitulate evolutionary history.
9Biology - The Life Science
15
The molecular biology study of slowly mutating genes reveal considerable evolutionary
history consistent with fossil and anatomical record.
2.6 Challenges to Darwin
Figure 3
Darwin and his theories have been challenged many times in the last 150 years. The
challenges have been primarily religious based on a perceived conﬂict with the preconceived
notion of creationism. Many of those who challenge Darwin have been adherents to the
young earth hypothesis that says that the Earth is only some 6000 years old and that all
species were individually created by a god. Some of the proponents of these theories have
suggested that chemical and physical laws that exist today were diﬀerent or nonexistent in
earlier ages. However, for the most part, these theories are either not scientiﬁcally testable
and fall outside the area of attention of the ﬁeld of biology, or have been disproved by one
or more ﬁelds of science.

185 Life: History and Origin
5.1 Properties of life
1. Organization: Being structurally composed of one or more cells, which are the basic
units of life.
• prokaryote: no nucleus
• eukaryote: membrane bound nucleus.
2. Sensitivity: respond to stimuli.
3. Energy Processing
4. Growth and Development
5. Reproduction
• hereditary mechanisms to make more of self; DNA based.
6. Regulation, including homeostasis.
7. Evolution.
5.2 Origin of life: 3 hypotheses
• Extraterrestrial origin (panspermia): meteor, comet borne from elsewhere in universe
• evidence of amino acids and other organic material in space (but often both D & L
forms)
• questionable bacterial fossils in Martian rock
-However, this would imply that some other origin of life was likely because it would have
had to happen elsewhere before it could be transported here, and the only diﬀerence would
be that life did not originate on Earth.
• Spontaneous origin on earth: primitive self-replicating macromolecules acted upon by
natural selection ((macro)Evolution is one example of this)
-This is often attacked for the seeming impossibility for life to have been produced by a
chemical reaction triggered by lightning and the ability of any produced DNA to actually be
in a sequence that could produce a working model of life if replicated. It is also attacked
for religious reasons, as it bypasses things like the idea of a supreme being directly creating
humans. It also seems unlikely to some that such huge changes are possible in evolution
19Life: History and Origin
without evidence of an "in-between stage" that is credible. Many of the stages of man are
disputed due to their somewhat shakey grounds. For example, bones from other animals
have been taken accidentally in some cases to be part of a humanoid, and complete skeletons
have been sketched out from a limited number of bones.
• Special creation: religious explanations (Intelligent Design is one popular example of
this.) These explanations contend that life was created by God (or perhaps some other
Intelligent Designer).
• Proponents of Intelligent design suggest that the vast complexity of life could only
have been intentionally designed while other creationists cite biblical support.
-This is often attacked for many of the same reasons that religion is attacked, and is often
regarded as superstitious and/or unscientiﬁc.
• It is debated as to whether schools should teach one hypothesis or the other when talking
about the origin of life. However, since they are all currently known major hypotheses
(and sometimes hypotheses proven wrong are shown for educational purposes), this
wikibook includes what it can without discriminating unfairly against one hypothesis or
the other.
5.3 The early earth
It is believed that the Earth was formed about 4.5 billion years ago.
• Heavy bombardment by rubble ceased about 3.8 billion years ago.
• Reducing atmosphere: much free H
• also H O, NH , CH
2 3 4
• little, if any, free O
2
• with numerous H electrons, require little energy to form organic compounds with C
• Warm oceans, estimated at 49-88°C
• Lack of O and consequent ozone (O ) meant considerable UV energy
2 3
Chemical reactions on early earth
• UV and other energy sources would promote chemical reactions and formation of organic
molecules
• Testable hypothesis: Miller-Urey experiment
• simulated early atmospheric conditions
• found amino acids, sugars, etc., building blocks of life
• won Nobel prize for work
• experiment showed prebiotic synthesis of biological molecules was possible
Issues
• Miller later conceded that the conditions in his experiments were not representative of
what is currently thought to be those of early earth
• He also conceded that science has no answer for how amino acids could self-organize into
replicating molecules and cells
• In the 50 years since Miller-Urey, signiﬁcant issues and problems for biogenesis have been
identiﬁed. This is a weak hypothesis at this time.
20Origin of cells
• Conclusion: Life exists, we don't know why.
5.4 Origin of cells
Cells are very small and decompose quickly after death. As such, fossils of the earliest cells
do not exist. Scientists have had to form a variety of theories on how cells (and hence life)
was created on Earth.
• Bubble hypothesis
• A. Oparin, J.B.S. Haldane, 1930’s
• Primary abiogenesis: life as consequence of geochemical processes
• Protobionts: isolated collections of organic material enclosed in hydrophobic bubbles
• Numerous variants: microspheres, protocells, protobionts, micelles, liposomes, coacer-
vates
• Other surfaces for evolution of life
• deep sea thermal vents
• ice crystals
• clay surfaces
• tidal pools
5.5 The RNA world?
• DNA→ RNA→ polypeptide (protein)
• Catalytic RNA: ribozyme
• discovered independently by Tom Cech and Sid Altman (Nobel prize)
• catalytic properties: hydrolysis, polymerization, peptide bond formation, etc.
• Self-replicating RNA molecule may have given rise to life
• consistent with numerous roles for RNA in cells as well as roles for ribonucleotides
(ATP)
• relationship to bubble-like structures is uncertain
5.6 The earliest cells
• Microfossils
• ˜3.5 by
• resemble bacteria: prokaryotes
• biochemical residues
• stromatolites
• Archaebacteria (more properly Archaea)
• extremophiles: salt, acid, alkali, heat, methanogens
• may not represent most ancient life
• Eubacteria
• cyanobacteria: photosynthesis
• atmospheric O ; limestone deposits
2
21Life: History and Origin
• chloroplasts of eukaryotes
Cyanobacteria
5.7 Major steps in evolution of life
• Prebiotic synthesis of macromolecules
• Self replication
• RNA? (primitive metabolism)
• DNA as hereditary material
• 1st cells
• Photosynthesis
• Aerobic respiration
• Multicellularity (more than once)

226 Cells
237 Cell structure
7.1 What is a cell?
The word cell comes from the Latin word "cella", meaning "small room", and it was ﬁrst
coined by a microscopist observing the structure of cork. The cell is the basic unit of all
living things, and all organisms are composed of one or more cells. Cells are so basic and
critical to the study of life, in fact, that they are often referred to as "the building blocks of
life". Organisms - bacteria, amoebae and yeasts, for example - may consist of as few as one
cell, while a typical human body contains about a trillion cells.
According to Cell Theory, ﬁrst proposed by Schleiden and Schwann in 1839, all life consists
of cells. The theory also states that all cells come from previously living cells, all vital
functions (chemical reactions) of organisms are carried out inside of cells, and that cells
contain necessary hereditary information to carry out necessary functions and replicate
themselves.
All cells contain:
1
• Lipid bilayer boundary (plasma membrane )
2
• Cytoplasm
3
• DNA (hereditary information)
4
• Ribosomes for protein synthesis
Eukaryotic cells also contain:
5
• At least one nucleus
6
• Mitochondria for cell respiration and energy
Cells may also contain:
7
• Lysosomes
8
• Peroxisomes
9
• Vacuoles
10
• Cell walls

25Cell structure
7.1.1 Concepts
Plasma Membrane
Phospholipid bilayer, which contains great amount of proteins, the most important functions
are the following:
1. It selectively isolates the content of the cell of the external atmosphere.
2. It regulates the interchange of substances between the cytoplasm and the environment.
3. Communicates with other cells.
Model of the ﬂuid mosaic
Describes the structure of the plasma membrane, this model was developed in 1972 by
cellular biologists J. Singer and L. Nicholson.
Phospholipid bilayer
Is in the plasma membrane and produces the ﬂuid part of membranes.
Proteins
Long chains of amino acids.
Glucose proteins
Proteins together with carbohydrates in the plasma membrane, mostly in the outer parts
of the cell.
Functions of proteins
Transport oxygen, they are components of hair and nails, and allow the cell interact with
its environment.
Transport Proteins
Regulate the movement of soluble water molecules, through the plasma membrane. Some
transport proteins called channel proteins form pores or channels in the membrane so
that water soluble molecules pass.
Carrying proteins
Have union sites that can hold speciﬁc molecules.
Reception proteins
They activate cellular responses when speciﬁc molecules join.
Proteins of recognition
They work as identiﬁers and as place of union to the cellular surface.
Fluid

move in response to the gradients.
Diﬀusion
Movement of the molecules in a ﬂuid, from the regions of high concentration to those of
low concentration.
Passive transport
Movement of substances in a membrane that doesn’t need to use energy.
Simple diﬀusion
Diﬀusion of water, gases or molecules across the membrane.
Facilitated diﬀusion
Diﬀusion of molecules across the membranes with the participation of proteins.
Osmosis
Diﬀusion of the water across a membrane with diﬀerential permeability.
Transport that needs energy
Movement of substances across a membrane generally in opposition to a gradient of
concentration with the requirement of energy.
Active transport
Movement of small molecules using energy (ATP).
Endocytosis
Movement of big particles towards the interior of the cell using energy. The cells enclose
particles or liquids.
Pinocytosis
(Literally cell drinking) Form in which the cell introduces liquids.
Phagocytosis
Way of eating of the cells. It feeds in this case of big particles or entire microorganisms.
Pseudopods
False feet (the amoeba).
Exocitosis
Movement of materials out of the cell with the use of energy. It throws waste material.
Isotonic
The cytoplasm ﬂuid of the interior of the cells is the same that the outer.
Hypertonic solution
27Cell structure
The solutions that have a higher concentration of dissolved particles than the cellular
cytoplasm and that therefore water of the cells goes out with osmosis.
Hypotonic
The solutions with a concentration of dissolved particles lower than the cytoplasm of a cell
and that therefore do that water enters the cell with osmosis.
Swelling
Pressure of the water inside the vacuole.
Endoplasmic Reticulum
It is the place of the synthesis of the cellular membrane.
7.1.2 Structure and function of the cell
Rudolf Virchow
Zoologist, who proposed the postulates of the cellular theory, observes that the living cells
could grow and be in two places at the same time, he proposed that all the cells come from
other equal cells and proposed 3 postulates:
1. Every living organism is formed from one or more cells
2. The smallest organisms are unicellular and these in turn are the functional units of
the multicellular organisms.
3. All the cells come from preexisting cells.
7.1.3 Common characteristics of all the cells
Molecular components
Proteins, amino acids, lipids, sweeten, DNA, RNA.
Structural components
Plasmatic membrane, citoplasm, ribosomes.
Robert Hooke
He postuled for the ﬁrst time the term cell
Prokaryotes
Their genetic material is not enclosed in a membrane ex. Bacterias
Eukaryotes
Their genetic material is contained inside a nucleus closed by a membrane
28History of cell knowledge
7.2 History of cell knowledge
The optical microscope was ﬁrst invented in 17th century. Shortly thereafter scientists began
to examine living and dead biological tissues in order to better understand the science of
life. Some of the most relevant discovery milestones of the time period include:
11
• The invention of the microscope , which allowed scientists for the ﬁrst time to see
biological cells
12
• Robert Hooke in 1665 looked at cork under a microscope and described what he called
cork "cells"
13
• Anton van Leeuwenhoek called the single-celled organisms that he saw under the
microscope "animalcules"
14
• Matthias Jakob Schleiden , a botanist, in 1838 determined that all plants consist of
cells
15
• Theodor Schwann , a zoologist, in 1839 determined that all animals consist of cells
16
• Rudolf Virchow proposed the theory that all cells arise from previously existing cells
In 1838, the botanist Matthias Jakob Schleiden and the physiologist Theodor Schwann
discovered that both plant cells and animal cells had nuclei. Based on their observations,
the two scientists conceived of the hypothesis that all living things were composed of cells.
In 1839, Schwann published 'Microscopic Investigations on the Accordance in the Structure
and Growth of Plants and Animals', which contained the ﬁrst statement of their joint cell
theory.
7.2.1 Cell Theory
Schleiden and Schwann proposed spontaneous generation as the method for cell origination,
17
but spontaneous generation (also called abiogenesis ) was later disproven. Rudolf Virchow
famously stated "Omnis cellula e cellula"... "All cells only arise from pre-existing cells." The
parts of the theory that did not have to do with the origin of cells, however, held up to
scientiﬁc scrutiny and are widely agreed upon by the scientiﬁc community today.
The generally accepted portions of the modern Cell Theory are as follows: (1) The cell is the
fundamental unit of structure and function in living things. (2) All organisms are made up
of one or more cells. (3) Cells arise from other cells through cellular division. (4) Cells carry
genetic material passed to daughter cells during cellular division. (5) All cells are essentially
the same in chemical composition. (6) Energy ﬂow (metabolism and biochemistry) occurs
within cells.

7.3 Microscopes
• Allow greater resolution, can see ﬁner detail
• Eye: resolution of ˜ 100 μm
18
• Light microscope : resolution of ˜ 200 nm
• Limited to cells are larger organelles within cells
19
• Confocal microscopy : 2 dimension view
20
• Electron microscope : resolution of ˜0.2 nm
• Laser tweezers: move cell contents
7.4 Cell size
One may wonder why all cells are so small. If being able to store nutrients is beneﬁcial
to the cell, how come there are no animals existing in nature with huge cells? Physical
limitations prevent this from occurring. A cell must be able to diﬀuse gases and nutrients in
and out of the cell. A cell's surface area does not increase as quickly as its volume, and as a
result a large cell may require more input of a substance or output of a substance than it
is reasonably able to perform. Worse, the distance between two points within the cell can
be large enough that regions of the cell would have trouble communicating, and it takes a
relatively long time for substances to travel across the cell.
That is not to say large cells don't exist. They are, once again, less eﬃcient at exchanging
materials within themselves and with their environment, but they are still functional. These
cells typically have more than one copy of their genetic information, so they can manufacture
proteins locally within diﬀerent parts of the cell.

308 Structure of Eukaryotic cells
1
Eukaryotic cells feature membrane delimited nucleii containing two or more linear chromo-
2 3 4
some s; numerous membrane-bound cytoplasmic organelles: mitochondria, RER , SER ,
5 6 7
lysosomes, vacuole s, chloroplast s; ribosomes and a cytoskeleton . Also, plants, fungi, and
some protists have a cell wall.
8.1 Structure of the nucleus
The nucleus is the round object in the cell that holds the genetic information (DNA) of the
cell. It is surrounded by a nuclear envelope and has a nucleolus inside.
8.1.1 Nuclear envelope
8
The nuclear envelope is a double-layered plasma membrane like the cell membrane, although
without membrane proteins. To allow some chemicals to enter the nucleus, the nuclear
9
envelope has structures called Nuclear pore s. The nuclear envelope is continuous with the
endoplasmic reticulum.
8.1.2 Nucleolus
The nucleolus appears in a microscope as a small dark area within the nucleus. The nucleolus
10
is the area where there is a high amount of DNA transcription taking place.

8.2 Chromatin
11
Chromosomes consist of chromatin . This is made up of strings of DNA, which typically
12
measure centimeters in length if stretched out. This DNA is wound around a histone core
13
and organized into nucleosome s.
14 15 16
The chromatin must be uncoiled for gene expression and replication . Chromosome

8.3 Endoplasmic reticulum
17 18
The endoplasmic reticulum is a cellular organelle made up of a series of extended folded
intracellular membranes. It is continuous with the nuclear membane.
There are two main types of endoplasmic reticulum:
19
• RER: rough endoplasmic reticulum (site of protein synthesis ) associated with ribosomes
20
• SER: smooth endoplasmic reticulum (site of lipid synthesis )
8.3.1 Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum
21
Proteins are directed to the RER by a signal sequence of a growing polypeptide s on
the ribosome. This is recognised by a signal recognition particle which brings the ribo-
some/polypeptide complex to a channel on the RER called a translocon. At the translocon,
the signal sequence and ribosome/polypeptide complex interact with the translocon to open
it. The signal sequence becomes attached to the translocon. The ribosome can continue to
translate the polypeptide into the lumen of the RER. As synthesis continues, 2 processes
can happen.
1. If the protein is destined to become a membrane bound protein then the protein
synthesis will continue until termination. The ribosome can then dissociate, allowing
protein folding within the RER lumen to occur and continuation to the golgi apparatus
for processing of the polypeptide.
2. Iftheproteinisdestinedforstorageforlatersecretionafterstimulationorforcontinuous
secretion then a protease-enzyme which cuts proteins at the peptide bond-can cut the
signal sequence from the growing polypeptide. Continuation to the golgi etc. can then
occur.

32Endoplasmic reticulum
When produced, proteins are then exported to one of several locations. The proteins are
either modiﬁed for extracellular membrane insertion or secretion. Note, this is in contrast
with ribosomes which do not associate with the RER and produce proteins which will become
cytosolic enzymes for example.
8.3.2 Smooth Endoplasmic Reticulum
22
Smooth endoplasmic reticulum produces enzyme s for lipid and carbohydrate biosynthesis
and detoxiﬁcation RER
8.3.3 Sarcoplasmic Reticulum
This is a specialised form of endoplasmic reticulum found in some muscle cell types-
particularly striated, skeletal muscle. Its main function is diﬀerent from the other 2 types in
that is mainly acts as a storage of calcium. This reticulum has voltage gated channels which
respond to signals from 'motor neurones' to open and release calcium into the cytoplasm.
This can then bring about the next part in muscle contraction.

8.4 The Golgi apparatus
24
The golgi apparatus is made up of multiple stacks of bilipid membranes.
• Proteins made on the RER are modiﬁed and then sorted
• Formation of secretory vesicles
• Formation of lysosomes (intracellular digestion)
Other membrane-bound cytoplasmic organelles include:
25
• Microbodies (generic term)
• Glyoxysome (transforms fat into carbohydrate in plants)
26
• Peroxisome (uses oxidative metabolism to form hydrogen peroxide and is destroyed by
27
catalase )
8.5 Ribosomes
Ribosomes are the site of protein synthesis. Ribosomes themselves are synthesized in the
28
cell nucleoli and are structured as two subunits, the large and the small. These parts are
composed of RNA and protein.
Prokaryotic and eukaryotic ribosomes are diﬀerent, the eukaryotic ones being larger and
more complicated.

8.7 Cytoskeleton
Cytoskeleton is a collective term for diﬀerent ﬁlaments of proteins that can give physical
shape within the cell and are responsible for the 'roads' which organelles can be carried
along.
• Gives the cell shape
• Anchors other organelles
• Vital to intracellular transport of large molecules
The cytoskeleton is composed of 3 main types of ﬁlaments:
33
• Actin ﬁlaments (7 nm)
34
• Microtubule s: (25 nm) polymer of tubulin; 13/ring.
35
• Intermediate Filament s
Both actin and microtubules can have associated motor proteins.
8.7.1 Intermediate Filaments
These are rope like ﬁlaments, 8-10nm in diameter and tend to give the structural stability to
cells. Examples inculude Vimentin, neuroﬁlaments and keratin. It is keratin which priniciply
makes up hair, nails and horns.
8.7.2 Actin Filaments
Growth
These ﬁlaments are 2-stranded and composed of dimeric subunits called G-Actin. They
contain a GTP molecule in order to bind (polymerise). As GTP is hydrolysed then the
structure becomes unstable and depolymerisation occurs. The growth of actin ﬁlaments is
concentration dependant-that is, the higher the concentration of free G-actin, the greater
the polymerisation. The are also polar, having a + and a - end (not related to charge) and
polymerisation tends to happen faster at the + end.

6 CO + 6 H O→ C H O + 6 O
2 2 6 12 6 2
• One of most important reactions in history of life:
• source of atmospheric O
2
• ultimately led to aerobic respiration and eukaryotes
• Responsible for bulk of glucose production
• Early experiments showed that mass of plant must be derived from substances in the air,
not the soil
• Experiments with isotopes showed that liberated oxygen comes from water
• Experiments also showed that light is essential but that some reactions (e.g., reduction of
CO ) continue in the dark
2
• Plants do two big, important things during photosynthesis: gain energy (absorb light)
and build sugar (glucose).
• Photosynthesis can be divided into two series of chemical reactions: the light (light-
dependent) reactions and the dark (light-independent) reactions. In light reactions, light
is absorbed; in dark reactions, sugar is built.
• Occurs when plants, algae, and autotrophic bacteria absorb light energy and build glucose.
13.1 Light Reactions
• Part of the electromagnetic spectrum
• Consists of units of energy called photons
• Photons at UV end of spectrum have more energy than those at the red end
• Occur on the surface of thylakoid disks
• Chlorophyll and other plant pigments diﬀerentially absorb photons
• Chlorophyll a: light to chemical energy
• Chlorophyll b: accessory chlorophyll
• Chlorophylls absorb primarily blue and red (green reﬂected back, hence the green
color of plants)
13.1.1 Accessory pigments
• Chlorophyll is a major light gathering pigment
• Absorbs light with considerable eﬃciency (i.e., retaining energy)
• Accessory pigments
• Chlorophyll b
• Carotenoinds
• capture light of wavelengths not captured by chlorophylls
51Photosynthesis
• Confer other colors to plant leaves (autumn colors too)
Photosynthetic steps
• Primary photoevent: light photon captured by photosystem and energy transferred to
electron donated by water
• Electron transport: excited electron is shuttled along imbedded series of electron carriers
to proton pump and electron is transferred to acceptor
• Chemiosmosis: transport of protons back into chloroplast drives synthesis of ATP
13.1.2 The Even More Detailed Light Reactions
What the Light Reactions Do:
The light reactions of photosynthesis occur in chloroplasts in and on the thylakoid disks.
During the light reactions, light energy charges up ATP molecules. More speciﬁcally, light
turns the chloroplast into an acid battery, and this battery charges up ATP.
How the "Chloroplast-Battery" Charges ATP:
The stroma is the ﬂuid inside of the chloroplasts, and it carries a negative charge. This
means that it contains about a "gazillion" extra electrons. The solvent of stroma is water.
The ﬂuid inside the thylakoid disks is positively charged because it contains a lot of hydrogen
(H+) ions. The pH here is low, making the ﬂuid very acidic. The solvent of thylakoid disk
ﬂuid is water.
A chloroplast acts like a battery, because it has separated a strong positive charge and a
strong negative charge in two diﬀerent compartments. Energy is released when H+ ions
(free protons) ﬂow from the inside of a thylakoid disk to the stroma. This is electrical energy,
since it is a ﬂow of charged particles.
The protons pass through special channels (made of protein) in the thylakoid membrane;
this reaction is 'exothermic.' The energy that is given oﬀ is used to fuel this reaction (Pi is
the phosphate ion):
ADP + Pi --> ATP
The proton can go to the negative stroma, but only if it uses its energy to charge up ATP.
Since one reaction wants to go, and the other one doesn't, and since the ﬁrst reaction releases
energy and the second one absorbs energy, the two reactions are known to be 'coupled'
together so that the ﬁrst fuels the second. Of course, a special enzyme must be involved for
this to happen.
Chlorophyll Molecules on a Thylakoid Disk:
Hundreds of chlorophyll molecules cover the surface of a thylakoid disk, making the disk
green. The nonpolar "tails" of the chlorophyll molecule are embedded in the membrane of
the thylakoid.
52“Dark” reactions
13.2 “Dark” reactions
• ATP drives endergonic reactions
• NADPH provides hydrogens for reduction of CO to carbohydrate (C-H bonds)
2
• Occur in the stroma
• First step in carbon ﬁxation
13.2.1 The Detailed Dark Reactions
What the Dark Reactions Do:
The dark reactions build sugar from carbon dioxide gas (CO2), water (H2O), and energy
from ATP molecules that were charged up during the light reactions. The dark reactions
occur in the stroma of a chloroplast. Dark reactions usually occur in the light, but they
don't have to. They'll occur in the dark until the chloroplast's supply of ATP runs out
(usually about 30 seconds).
The Calvin Cycle:
The Calvin Cycle is the fancy name for the metabolic pathway that builds sugar. This
means that it involves a whole lot of chemical reactions, and it uses a lot of diﬀerent enzymes
to catalyze the reactions.
Carbon dioxide gas is stable, therefore the bonds that hold the carbon and oxygen atoms
are strong. Therefore it takes a lot of energy to break the bonds and separate the carbon
atoms from the oxygen atoms. The energy needed to do this comes from ATP molecules.
When inorganic carbon (like from CO2) is being added to an organic molecule (such as
sugar), this is called carbon ﬁxation.
It takes 2 complete turns of the Calvin Cycle to make a glucose molecule.

How cells divide
13.3 Prokaryote cell division
• Binary ﬁssion
• Doubling of cell contents, including DNA
• Fission to divide contents
• Segregation of replicated genomes by growth of membrane between attachment points
• Partitioning of cytoplasmic components
• Escherichia coli
• Capable of cell division every 20 minutes under optimal conditions (DNA in continuous
state of replication)
• Model organism of bacterial cell division
53Photosynthesis
13.4 Bacterial DNA replication
• Replication follows rules of base pairing, with each polynucleotide chain serving as
template for synthesis of its complement.
• Genetic evidence showed that the bacterial chromosome is circular long before there was
corroborating physical evidence.
Eukaryotic chromosomes
• Discovered by Walther Fleming in 1882 in dividing cells of salamander larvae, following
improvements in microscopes and staining technology
• He called division mitosis (mitos = “thread”)
• Chromosome number is constant in a species
• Ranges from 2 to >500 (46 in human somatic cells)
• Homologous pairs, one contributed by each parent
• Change in number is cause and consequence of speciation
• Chromosome constancy and their precise division in mitosis and meiosis led biologists to
postulate that they were carriers of hereditary information
13.5 Chromosome number
• 1N = number of chromosomes in gamete
• 1N = haploid chromosome number
• 2N = number of chromosomes in somatic cells (cells that are not egg or sperm)
• 2N = diploid
• Deviations from N or 2N are usually lethal in animals
Chromosome numbers
13.6 Eukaryotic chromosomes
• Consist of chromatin
• DNA and associated proteins, mainly histones
• Nucleosomal organization
• Euchromatin: unwound chromatin, in basic nucleosomal conﬁguration; genes available
for expression
• Heterochromatin: highly condensed except during replication
• Karyotype: array of chromosomes an individual possesses
• Clinical importance (Down syndrome; cancer)
• Evolutionary importance (speciation)
54Chromosome organization
13.7 Chromosome organization
13.8 Human karyotype stained by chromosome painting
13.9 Chromosomes
• Homologous pairs
• Inherited one from each parent
• Identical in length and position of centromere
• Contain identical or similar genes
• Homologous pair = homologs
• Morphology
• After replication, consist of two sister chromatids attached to a centromere
13.10 Human chromosomes
• Diploid number = 2n = 46 = 23 pairs of homologs
• Haploid number = 23 (gametes)
• Each replicated chromosome contains 2 sister chromatids = 92 chromatids
Cell cycle
• Growth and division cycle of cells
• Precisely controlled by biochemical and gene activity, except in cancer
• Phases
• G1: primary growth phase
• S: DNA replication; chromosome replication
• G2: second growth phase; preparation for mitosis
• M: mitosis; nuclear division
• C: cytoplasmic division
13.11 Mitotic cell cycle
• Cells exiting the cell cycle are said to be in G0
• Cell cycle time varies with stages of life cycle and development, with G1 the most variable
• DNA replication occurs during S phase of the cell cycle following G1.
- at this point the chromosomes are composed of two sister
chromotids connected by a common centromere.
55Photosynthesis
13.12 Replicated human chromosomes
13.13 Mitosis
• Nuclear division
• equational division of replicated chromosomes
• chromatids move to opposite poles
• Continuous process
• prophase
• metaphase
• anaphase
• telophase
• Driven by motors and microtubules
• No change in chromosome number
• N→ N by mitosis
• 2N→ 2N by mitosis
• May be accompanied by cytokinesis
Kinetochore Microtubules attach to kinetochores. Metaphase
• Momentary alignment of chromosomes in center of cell
Anaphase
13.14 Plant mitosis
• Similar to animal mitosis
• New cell wall formed between cells from membrane partition
Cell cycle control
• Cell cycle events are regulated by protein complexes and checkpoints
• Discovered by microinjection of proteins in to eggs, by mutational analysis and by
techniques of molecular biology
Molecular control of cell cycle: Cdk and cyclin
• Cyclin dependent protein kinase (Cdk)
• Phosphorylate serine/threonine of target regulatory proteins
• Function only when bound to cyclin
• Cyclin: short-lived proteins that bind to cdks
13.15 Controlling the cell cycle
• External signals initiate cell division in multicellular organisms
• Growth factors: extracellular regulatory signals
• Usually soluble; bind to cell surface receptor
56Cancer
• Sometimes membrane bound, requiring cell-cell contact with receptor
• E.g., upon wound, platelets release PDGF which stimulates ﬁbroblasts to enter cell
cycle (exit G0), to heal wound
13.16 Cancer
• Unregulated cell proliferation
• Cancer cells have numerous abnormalities
• >46 chromosomes
• Mutations in proto-oncogenes
• Encode proteins stimulating the cell cycle
• May be regulated by phosphorylation
• Often over expressed in cancer cells
• Mutations in tumor-suppressor genes
• Encode proteins inhibiting the cell cycle
• Often bind to products of proto-oncogenes
• May be regulated by phosphorylation

5714 Sexual reproduction
14.1 Sexual
• Exclusively eukaryotes
• Fusion of two haploid genomes
• Fertilization (= syngamy)
• Forms new individuals in multicellular organisms as result of fusion of egg and sperm
• Plants
• Animals
• Meiosis yields haploid genomes at some point in life cycle
14.2 Sexual life cycle
Typical animal life cycle
• Meiosis occurs in germ line cells in gonads producing haploid gametes
• All other cells are somatic cells

• Preceded by one round of DNA (chromosome) replication
• Two rounds of nuclear (& usually cell) division
• Meiosis I
• Synapsis of homologs
• Segregation of homologs
• Reduction division, 2n to n
• Meiosis II
• No chromosome replication
• Segregation of sister chromatids
• Formation of 4 haploid (n) cells
• Two nuclear divisions, usually 2 cell divisions, only one round of replication
• Meiosis I
• Prophase: synapsis and crossing over
• Metaphase
59Sexual reproduction
• Anaphase: chromosome segregation

14.5 Crossing over
• Reciprocal, physical exchange between nonsister chromatids
• Type of recombination; mixes maternal and paternal genes
• Visual evidence: chiasmata
14.6 Microtubules and anaphase I
• During prophase microtubules attach to kinetochores on one side of centromere
• The metaphase checkpoint insures proper attachment
• A phosphorylation event initiates motor activity and anaphase
14.7 Meiosis II
• Cytologically similar to mitosis
• No preceding DNA replication
• Chromatids segregate and move to opposite poles as chromosomes
• 4 haploid cells produced
• In animals, these cells diﬀerentiate into gametes
• In plants and many other organisms, these cells divide by mitosis, followed some time
later by gamete formation
14.8 Evolution of sex
• Asexual reproduction: all oﬀspring genetically identical to parent
60Consequences of sex
• Sex: recombination destroys advantageous combinations
• So why sex?
• Many hypotheses
• Eﬀect repair of genetic damage?
• Much pachytene repair as well as gene conversion
• Some protists form diploid cells in response to stress
• Recombination breaks up combinations of genes favoring parasites, thus reducing
parasitism?
14.9 Consequences of sex
• Recombination: generates genetic diversity
• Crossing over
• Independent assortment
• Random fertilization
• Qualities of gamete usually do NOT reﬂect qualities of genes enclosed in gamete

6115 Genetics
6316 Gregor Mendel and biological
inheritance
1
Charles Darwin , for all he contributed to the science of biology, never knew about the
mechanism by which living things inherit traits from previous generations, or how new traits
arise.
As any schoolchild can tell you, this mechanism of interitance has since been found to be
2
DNA , or deoxyribonucleic acid. DNA allows for stable inheritance of traits: the code in
each strand of DNA is replicated precisely through the pairing of basic units along each
strand. The error rate in this replication is amazingly low; not even one base pair in a
million matches out of sequence.
However, when even one base pair is added to a new strain of DNA in an order diﬀerently
than in the parent chain, it can be the basis of amutation. These changes in DNA sequences
are the microscopic origin of changes in traits of all studied living things. Even the smallest
diﬀerence in a strand of DNA can result in a change in traits that can cost the life of the
organism. Mutations can produce proteins with a new or altered function. In humans, the
3
example of Sickle cell anemia is commonly given as its origin is a diﬀerence of only one
base pair in a section of DNA that encodes red blood cells.
Individual sequences of DNA that encode for speciﬁc proteins are called genes and are the
4
units of heredity. Each one has a set nucleotide , and together all of the genes (and some
sequence of DNA that apparently do not code for any biologically important functions)
5
together make up the entire chromosome
16.1 Mendel
• Discovered principle of genetic segregation via numerous experiments utilizing pea plants
• Inferred the existence of genes through segregation of phenotypes
• Used quantitative methods: counted; ratios
• Work is model of scientiﬁc method
• In particular, observed the F2 progeny, which lead to the discovery of dominant and
recessive traits
• Published work in 1866, went unnoticed
• In 1900 his scientiﬁc paper was “rediscovered”

3 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sickle%20cell%20anaemia
4 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nucleotide
5 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chromosome
65Gregor Mendel and biological inheritance
• Mendel is acknowledged as founder of Genetics
• still used alphabet letters to designate genes
• still refer to dominant and recessive genes
• still refer to segregation of alleles in meiosis
• principle of segregation applies to all sexually reproducing organisms; Mendel’s results
were immediately applied to humans in 1900
16.2 Mendel’s experiments
• 1856, began experiments with the garden pea, Pisum sativum
• 1865, presented results to the Bruno natural history society, which he helped found
• 1866, published his results in proceedings of the society
• Naegeli encouraged Mendel to reproduce results in another species, which failed because
the species did not undergo true fertilization
• discrete traits in Pisum sativum
• pure-breeding lines
• dominant/recessive alleles
• alleles are two alternate versions of a gene
• gametes contain hybridized chromosomes that are formed during meiosis
• homozygous has two of the same allele
• heterozygous has two diﬀerent alleles
• reciprocal F1 crosses (all exhibiting dominant phenotypes); F2; F3
• counted oﬀspring, noted ratios
• inferred genotypes from phenotypes
• tested hypotheses with testcrosses
• attempted to repeat with another species
16.3 Mendel’s seven pairs of traits
1. Seed form (round or wrinkled)
2. Cotyledon color (green or yellow)
3. Seed coat color (white or colored)
4. Pod form (inﬂated or constricted)
5. Pod color (green or yellow)
6. Flower position (axial or terminal)
7. Plant heights (tall or short)
16.4 Locus
• The location of a speciﬁc gene within a chromosome
66Modern Y chromosome
16.5 Modern Y chromosome
Y-chromosome is the most evolved chromosome. Generally it is thought that if Y- chro-
mosome is present in an individual then he will be male. But if mutation occurs at sex
determining region or zinc factor then it will not code for testis determining factor, and
results in normal female. This type of female's frequency is 1/250000.
16.6 Chromosome phenomena
• X-chromosome inactivation
• Barr bodies
• Nondisjunction: failure of chromosome segregation at meiosis or mitosis
• Results in 2N± 1 chromosome number
• Trisomy 2N + 1
• Usually lethal. Trisomy 21 (Down) exception
• Monosomy 2N ** 1
• Lethal except XO
• Usually maternal origin in humans
16.7 X-chromosome inactivation
In females, one X-chromosone is randomly switched oﬀ forming a Barr body.
16.8 Barr body
Dense region in the nucleus formed by the inactive X-chromosome.
16.9 Human genetic disorders
Down's Syndrome(Mongolism)
Down's Syndrome is usually produced by the nondisjunction of chromosome 21 during
oogenesis and sometimes during spermatogenesis. The individual suﬀering from this type of
syndrome has 47 chromosomes instead of the normal 46. The extra chromosome is not a sex
chromosome but an autosome.
Most cases of mongolism were found to occur in children born by women in their forties.
The aﬀected children, called mongoloids, show mental retardation and have a shorter life
expectancy. Their most prominent feature is the Mongolian folds in their eyes; hence, the
term mongolism.
Klinefelter's Syndrome
67Gregor Mendel and biological inheritance
When an XY-bearing sperm unites with an X-bearing egg, the resulting condition is called
Klinefelter's Syndrome, or sexually undeveloped male. Individuals having the syndrome
show the following characteristics:
• testes are small
• sperms are never produced
• breasts are enlarged
• body hair is sparse
• individuals are mentally defective
The same abnormal meiotic division may occur in females. They produce eggs with XX or
no sex chromosomes. Such egg, when fertilized by a Y-bearing sperm, will not develop (YO).
This is because YO is lethal--it wil cause death to the oﬀspring.
6817 DNA: The Genetic Material
17.1 DNA
DNA stands for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid. That is, a nucleic acid with two sugars. DNA is
the hereditary material of cells and is considered the blueprint of life. DNA is found in all
kingdoms of life. Even most viruses have DNA. A molecule of DNA is chemically stable (it
does not have a 2-prime alcohol group.)
When someone says DNA, they may be referring to one's genetic material on multiple levels:
They may be speaking about a single deoxyribose nucleic acid molecule, a section of a double
helix, a section of a chromosome, or one's entire hereditary composition.
• antiparallel
• Double helix
• Semiconservative replication
• Sequence of nucleotides encodes functional RNA or polypeptide
17.2 Historical perspective
• Mitosis and meiosis
• Regular distribution of chromosomes suggested that they contain hereditary informa-
tion
• Bridges/Morgan, usingDrosophilamelanogastershowedthatgenesareonchromosomes
(1910s)
• Hammerling: nucleus contains hereditary information (1930s)
• Griﬃth: transformation of bacteria (1928)
• Avery, MacLeod, McCarty: transforming substance is DNA (1944)
• Hershey, Chase: DNA is hereditary material of viruses (1952)
• Rosalind Franklin
• Watson and Crick: structure of DNA (1953)
17.3 Hershey-Chase Experiment
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading suggestions that DNA was a
genetic material. Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA
into a bacterium. They did two experiments marking either the DNA in the phage with
a radioactive phophorus or the protein of the phage with radioactive sulfur. With the
bacteria that was infected by the phages with radioactive DNA the DNA in the bacteria
69DNA: The Genetic Material
was radioactive. In the bacteria that was infected with the radioactive protein the bacteria
was radioactive, not the DNA. This proves that DNA is a genetic material and it is passed
on in viruses.
17.4 DNA/RNA components
• Miescher: discovered DNA, 1869
17.4.1 Structure of DNA
DNA is in a double helix structure made up of nucleotides. The "backbone" of the double
helix is composed of phosphates connected to a ﬁve carbon sugar called deoxyribose, . The
"rungs" are composed of nitrogenous bases, Purines and Pyrimidines. Purines contain
Adenine(A) and Guanine(G) and have two rings in their structures. Pyrimidines contain
Cytosine(C) and Thymine (T) and have one ring in their structures.

8020 Mutation
1
A mutation is a permanent change to an organism's genetic material (DNA or RNA).
Mutations are a rare but signiﬁcant biological process, since they provide the variation on
2
which evolution acts and are also the source of cancer.
3
An organism's genetic material is made up of polymers (chains) of four diﬀerent nucleotides ,
like a recipe book written in a language of only four letters. A mutation event is when the
order of the nucleotides in DNA change, usually when the DNA is being copied.
Mutations come in a number of forms:
20.1 Point Mutations
Point mutations are all mutations which involve a single nucleotide. These come in the form
of substitutions, insertions and deletions:
20.2 Substitution
Substitution Mutations: In substitution mutations, a nitrogenous base of a triplet codon of
DNA is replaced by another nitrogen base or some derivative of the nitrogen base, changing
the codon. The altered codon codes for a diﬀerent amino acid substitution.The substitution
mutations are of two types:
1.Transitions: It is the replacement of one purine in a polynucleotide chain by another
purine(A by G or C by A) or one pyrimidine by another pyrimidine(T by C or C by T)
2.Transversions:A base pair substitution involving the substitution of a purine by pyrimidine
or pyrimidine by a purine is called transversion.

but can also include inversions, rearrangement of nucleotides and duplication of entire genes:
20.3.1 Inversion
20.3.2 Rearrangement
20.3.3 Gene/Exon Duplications
Transposition
Retrotransposition
20.4 Chromosomal mutations
Chromosomal mutations involve changes to entire chromosomes. These mutations are
particularly rare:
20.4.1 Translocation
20.4.2 Fusion
20.4.3 Fission
20.4.4 Segmental Duplication
20.4.5 Chromosomal Duplication
20.4.6 Genome Duplication
20.5 Causes of mutations
20.6 Eﬀects of mutations
Mutations can have a variety of diﬀerent eﬀects depending on the type of mutation, the
signiﬁcance of the piece of genetic material aﬀected and whether the cells aﬀected are germ-
82Further reading
line cells. Only mutations in germ-line cells can be passed on to children, while mutations
elsewhere can cause cell-death or cancer.
Mutations can be classiﬁed by their eﬀects:
20.6.1 Silent Mutation
Silent Mutations are DNA mutations that do not result in a change to the amino acid
sequence or a protein. They may occur in a non-coding region (outside of a gene or within
an intron), or they may occur within an exon in a manner that does not alter the ﬁnal
amino acid chain.
20.6.2 Frameshift
20.6.3 Missense Mutation
Missense mutations are types of point mutations where a single nucleotide is changed to
cause substitution of a diﬀerent amino acid. This in turn can render the resulting protein
nonfunctional. Such mutations are responsible for diseases such as Epidermolysis bullosa.

9122 Classiﬁcation of Living Things
22.0.1 Classiﬁcation of Living Things & Naming
With so many ﬂora and fauna on planet Earth, there must be a method to classify each
organism to distinguish it from others so it can be correctly identiﬁed. Classiﬁcation does
not only apply to biology. For example, supermarkets and grocery stores organise their
products by classifying them. Beverages may occupy one aisle, while cleaning supplies may
occupy another. In science, the practice of classifying organisms is called taxonomy (Taxis
means arrangement and nomos means law). The modern taxonomic system was developed
by the Swedish botanist Carolus (Carl) Linneaeus (1707-1788). He used simple physical
characteristics of organisms to identify and diﬀerentiate between diﬀerent species.
Linneaeus developed a hierarchy of groups for taxonomy. To distinguish diﬀerent levels of
similarity, each classifying group, called taxon (pl. taxa) is subdivided into other groups.
To remember the order, it is helpful to use a mnemonic device. The taxa in hierarchical
order:
• Domain - Archea, Eubacteria, Eukaryote
• Kingdom - Plants, Animals, Fungi, Protists, Eubacteria (Monera), Archaebacteria
• Phylum
• Class
• Order
• Family
• Genus
• Species
The domain is the broadest category, while species is the most speciﬁc category available.
The taxon Domain was only introduced in 1990 by Carl Woese, as scientists reorganise
things based on new discoveries and information. For example, the European Hare would
be classiﬁed as follows:
Eukaryote --> Animal --> Chordata --> Mammalia --> Lagomorpha --> Leporidae -->
Lepus --> Lepus europaeus.
Binomial nomenclature is used to name an organism, where the ﬁrst word beginning
with a capital is the genus of the organism and the second word beginning with lower-case
letter is the species of the organism. The name must be in italics and in Latin, which was
the major language of arts and sciences in the 18th century. The scientiﬁc name can be also
abbreviated, where the genus is shortened to only its ﬁrst letter followed by a period. In our
example, Lepus europaeus would become L. europaeus'.
Taxonomy and binomial nomenclature are both speciﬁc methods of classifying an organism.
They help to eliminate problems, such as mistaken identity and false assumptions, caused
by common names. An example of the former is the fact that a North American robin is
93Classiﬁcation of Living Things
quite diﬀerent from the English robin. An example of the latter is the comparison between
crayﬁsh and catﬁsh, where one might believe that they both are ﬁsh when in fact, they are
quite diﬀerent.
Nomenclature is concerned with the assignment of names to taxonomic groups in agreement
with published rules.
22.0.2 Eukaryotes & Prokaryotes
Recall that there are two basic types of cells: eukaryotes and prokaryotes.
Eukaryotes are more complex in structure, with nuclei and membrane-bound organelles.
Some characteristics of eukaryotes are:
• Large (100 - 1000 μm)
• DNA in nucleus, bounded by membrane
• Genome consists of several chromosomes.
• Sexual reproduction common, by mitosis and meiosis
• Mitochondria and other organelles present
• Most forms are multicellular
• Aerobic
Prokaryotes refer to the smallest and simplest type of cells, without a true nucleus and no
membrane-bound organelles. Bacteria fall under this category. Some characteristics:
• Small (1-10 μm)
• DNA circular, unbounded
• Genome consists of single chromosome.
• Asexual reproduction common, not by mitosis or meiosis.
• No general organelles
• Most forms are singular
• Anaerobic
22.0.3 The Three Domains
The three domains are organised based on the diﬀerence between eukaryotes and prokaryotes.
Today's living prokaryotes are extremely diverse and diﬀerent from eukaryotes. This fact has
been proven by molecular biological studies (e.g. of RNA structure) with modern technology.
The three domains are as follows:
Archea (Archeabacteria) consists of archeabacteria, bacteria which live in extreme
environments. The kingdom Archaea belongs to this domain.
Eubacteriaconsistsofmoretypicalbacteriafoundineverydaylife. ThekingdomEubacteria
belongs to this domain.
Eukaryote encompasses most of the world's visible living things. The kingdoms Protista,
Fungi, Plantae, and Animalia fall under this category.
94Stem cells
22.0.4 The Six Kingdoms
Under the three domains are six kingdoms in taxonomy. The ﬁrst two, Plants andAnimals,
are commonly understood and will not be expounded here.
Protista, the third kingdom, was introduced by the German biologist Ernst Haeckel in
1866 to classify micro-organisms which are neither animals nor plants. Since protists are
quite irregular, this kingdom is the least understood and the genetic similarities between
organisms in this kingdom are largely unknown. For example, some protists can exhibit
properties of both animals and plants.
Fungi are organisms which obtain food by absorbing materials in their bodies. Mushrooms
and moulds belong in this kingdom. Originally, they were part of the plant kingdom but
were recategorised when they were discovered not to photosynthesise.
Eubacteria are bacteria, made up of small cells, which diﬀer in appearance from the
organisms in the above kingdoms. They lack a nucleus and cell organelles. They have cell
walls made of peptidoglycan.
Archae (or Archaebacteria) are bacteria which live in extreme environments, such as
salt lakes or hot, acidic springs. These bacteria are in their own category as detailed studies
have shown that they have unique properties and features (ex. unusual lipids that are not
found in any other organism)which diﬀer them from other bacteria and which allow them to
live where they live. Their cell walls lack peptidoglycan.
22.0.5 Origins of Diversity
The diversity in our planet is attributed to diversity within a species. As the world changed
in climate and in geography as time passed, the characteristics of species diverged so much
that new species were formed. This process, by which new species evolve, was ﬁrst described
by British naturalist Charles Darwin as natural selection.
For an organism to change, genetic mutations must occur. At times, genetic mutations are
accidental, as in the case of prokaryotes when they undergo asexual reproduction. For most
eukaryotes, genetic mutations occur through sexual reproduction, where meiosis produces
haploid gametes from the original parent cells. The fusion of these haploid gametes into
a diploid zygote results in genetic variation in each generation. Over time, with enough
arrangement of genes and traits, new species are produced. Sexual reproduction creates an
immense potential of genetic variety.
One goal of taxonomy is to determine the evolutionary history of organisms. This can be
achieved by comparing species living today with species in the past. The comparison in
anatomy and structure is based on data from development, physical anatomy, biochemistry,
DNA, behaviour, and ecological preferences. The following are examples of how such data is
used:
• Anatomy:
Although a horse and a human may look diﬀerent, there is evidence that their arm structures
are quite similar. Their arms' sizes and proportions may be diﬀerent, but the anatomical
structures are quite similar. Such evidence reveals that animals in diﬀerent taxa may not
95Classiﬁcation of Living Things
be that diﬀerent. Biological features from a common evolutionary origin are known as
homologous.
• Development
• Biochemistry:
Biochemical analysis of animals similar in appearance have yielded surprising results. For
example, although guinea pigs were once considered to be rodents, like mice, biochemistry
led them to be in their taxon of their own.
22.0.6 Phylogeny, Cladistics & Cladogram
Modern taxonomy is based on many hypotheses' of the evolutionary history of organisms,
known as phylogeny. As with the Scientiﬁc Method, scientists develop a hypothesis on the
history of an animal and utilise modern science and technology to prove the phylogeny.
Cladistics is a classiﬁcation system which is based on phylogeny. Expanding on phylogeny,
cladistics is based on the assumption that each group of related species has one common
ancestor and would therefore retain some ancestral characteristics. Moreover, as these
related species evolve and diverge from their common ancestor, they would develop unique
characteristics. Such characteristics are known as derived characteristics
The principles of phylogeny and cladistics can be expressed visually as a cladogram,
a branching diagram which acts as a family (phylogenetic) tree for similar species. A
cladogram can also be used to test alternative hypotheses for an animal's phylogeny. In
order to determine the most likely cladogram, the derived characteristics of similar species
are matched and analysed.

22.1 Introduction
Viruses are the smallest biological particle (the tiniest are only 20 nm in diameter). However,
they are not biological organisms so they are not classiﬁed in any kingdom of living things.
They do not have any organelles and cannot respire or perform metabolic functions. Viruses
are merely strands of DNA or RNA surrounded by a protective protein coat called a capsid.
Viruses only come to life when they have invaded a cell. Outside of a host cell, viruses are
completely inert.
Since ﬁrst being identiﬁed in 1935, viruses have been classiﬁed into more than 160 major
groups. Viruses are classiﬁed based on their shape, replication properties, and the diseases
that they cause. Furthermore, the shape of a virus is determined by the type and arrangement
of proteins in its capsid. Viruses pathogenic to humans are currently classiﬁed into 21 groups.
Viruses can also attack bacteria and infect bacterial cells. Such viruses are called bacterio-
phages.
97Classiﬁcation of Living Things
22.2 Viral Replication
As previously stated, viruses are not a biological life form so they cannot reproduce by
themselves. They need to take over a functioning eukaryotic or prokaryotic cell to replicate
its DNA or RNA and to make protein coat for new virus particles.
In order to enter a cell, a virus must attach to a speciﬁc receptor site on the plasma membrane
of the host cell. The proteins on the surface of the virus act as keys which ﬁt exactly into a
matching glycoprotein on the host cell membrane. In some viruses, the attachment protein
is not on the surface of the virus but is in the capsid or in the envelope.
There are two forms of viral replication: the lytic cycle and the lysogenic cycle.
22.2.1 Lytic Cycle
1. Attachment: The virus binds to speciﬁc receptors on the host cell.
2. Entry: There are two ways in which a virus can enter cells. Firstly, the virus can inject
its nucleic acid into the host cell. Secondly, if a virus is contained in an envelope, the
host cell can phagocytosise the entire virus particle into a vacuole. When the virus
breaks out of the vacuole, it then releases its nucleic acid into the cell.
3. Replication: The virus's nucleic acid instructs the host cell to replicate the virus's
DNA or RNA.
4. Assembly: New virus particles are assembled.
5. Lysis and Release: The virus directs the production of an enzyme which damages
the host cell wall, causing the host cell to swell and burst. The newly formed virus
particles are now released.
22.2.2 Lysogenic Cycle
1. Attachment: Similar to Lytic Cycle
2. Entry: Similar to Lytic Cycle
3. Incorporation: The viral nucleic acids is not replicated, but instead integrated by
genetic combination (crossing over) into the host cell's chromosome. When integrated
in a host cell this way, the viral nucleic acid as part of the host cell's chromosome is
known as a prophage.
4. Host Cell Reproduction: The host cell reproduces normally. Subsequent cell divisions,
daughter cells, contain original father cell's chromosome embedded with a prophage.
5. Cycle Induction: Certain factors now determine whether the daughter cell undergoes
the lytic or lysogenic cycle. At any time, a cell undergoing the lysogenic cycle can
switch to the lytic cycle.
The reproduction cycle of viruses with RNA and no DNA is slightly diﬀerent. A notable
example of a RNA-based virus is HIV, a retrovirus.
98Viral Genome
Retrovirus reproductive cycle
1. The retrovirus force RNA into cell, by either one of the two methods of entry (See
above).
2. In the retrovirus are reverse transcriptase enzymes, which catalyses the synthesis of a
DNA strand complementary to the viral RNA.
3. Reverse transcriptase catalyses a second DNA strand complementary to the ﬁrst. With
these two strands, the double-stranded DNA can be created.
4. DNA is then incorporated into the host cell's chromosomes. Similar to the concept of
a prophage, this incorporated DNA is called a provirus. However, the provirus never
leaves the host cell, unlike a prophage.
5. The infected host cell undergoes the lytic or lysogenic cycle.
22.3 Viral Genome
The genome of a virus consists of DNA or RNA, whose size and conﬁguration vary. The
entire genome can exist as a single nucleic acid molecule or several nucleic acid segments.
Also, the DNA or RNA may be single-stranded or double-stranded, and either linear or
circular.
Not all viruses can reproduce in a host cell by themselves. Since viruses are so small, the
size of their genome is limiting. For example, some viruses have coded instructions for only
making a few diﬀerent proteins for the viruses' capsid. On the other hand, the human
genome codes for over 30,000 diﬀerent proteins. Therefore, the lack of coded instructions
cause some viruses to need the presence of other viruses to help them reproduce themselves.
Such viruses are called replication defective.
Lastly, it is worthy to note that 70% of all viruses are RNA viruses. As the process of RNA
replication (with enzymes and other organelles of the host cell) is more prone to errors, RNA
viruses have much higher mutation rates than do DNA viruses.
22.4 Viruses Practice Questions
1. As the name implies, the Tomato Spotted Wilt Virus targets tomatoes. Would it be
possible for this virus to target other fruits as well? Explain.
2. If a DNA and a RNA virus both infected somatic cells, which virus would be more
diﬃcult to detect?
3. Many people have had cold sores, which are caused by infection with the herpes
simplex virus. One characteristic of cold sores is that after a period of inactivity, they
will reappear many times during the course of a person's life. Which cycle would the
herpes simplex virus undergo?
4. Chicken pox is a common, non-fatal disease usually acquired in adolescence and caused
by the varicella zoster virus. In adulthood, many people suﬀer from shingles, an altered
form of the varicella zoster virus. Which cycle would the varicella zoster virus have
undergone?
5. Would an antibiotic work for a person suﬀering from a cold of ﬂu? Explain.

100Domains of life: characteristics
22.7 Domains of life: characteristics
This text is based on notes very generously donated by Paul Doerder, Ph.D., of the Cleveland
State University.
22.8 Introduction
Out of the six kingdoms, Protista is the most diverse. This is the kingdom of organisms
with strange, atypical characteristics. In essence, this kingdom is designated for organisms
which do not belong in any other kingdom. The majority of protists are microscopic.
22.9 Classiﬁcation of Protists
There are three phyla of protists, based on their type of nutrition.
1. Protozoa (animal-like protists) are heterotrophs that ingest or absorb their food.
2. Algae (plant-like protists) are autotrophs they get nutrition from photosythesis.
3. Slime moulds and water moulds (fungus-like protists) are also heterotrophs, like
protozoa.
22.10 Protozoa
As heterotrophs, protozoa scavenge materials from their surroundings. Others are predators
which actively hunt or ambush small organisms such as bacteria and other protozoa for a
source of nutrition. Protozoa can be parasitic as well; they may live inside larger organisms,
like humans. Most protozoa live as single cells, although a few form colonies.
Protozoa are generally diﬃcult to identify due to their varied shape. They may appear as
jelly-like blobs, spherical sunbursts, or a ﬂattened leaf. Tiny blood parasites may be only 2
μm long. On the other hand, shell-covered marine may be 5 cm or more in diameter.
Furthermore, diﬀerent protozoans have their own complex life cycles. The complexity has
led certain organisms to be mistakenly classiﬁed for other species.
Nevertheless, protozoa can move, and so, they are classiﬁed based on their methods of
locomotion.
Characteristics of Protozoa :
• About 30,000 species known
• About 10,000 species are pathogenic, including some of the worst human diseases
• heterotrophic
• highly variable in form and life cycle
101Classiﬁcation of Living Things
• mostly unicellular
• range in size from 0.005 mm to 50 mm
• lack cell walls
they love environment and each other..............
22.11 Algae
Algae are much simpler than protozoa. They are aquatic and contain chlorophyll. Algae can
exist as a single cell or as giant seaweeds 60 m in length. Formerly, algae were classiﬁed as
plants but this was incorrect as algae lack parts of true plants: leaves, stems, roots, xylem,
and phloem. Since algae belong in the kingdom Protista, algae is a broad term used to
denote all aquatic eukaryotes which photosynthesise; algae can diﬀer in size and shape as
well.
There are six phyla of algae:chlorophytes (green algae), phaeophytes (brown algae),
rhodophytes (red algae), chrysophytes (diatoms), pyrrophytes (dinoﬂagellates),
and euglenophytes (euglenoids).
22.11.1 Chlorophytes
Chlorophytes resemble plants the most. Like plants, their cell walls contain cellulose and
they store food in reserve as starch. Chlorophytes can be unicellular or multicellular. Most
chlorophytes use ﬂagellae for some locomotion.
22.11.2 Phaeophytes
Phaeophytes are nearly all multicellular marine organisms, which are known to us as seaweeds.
They have cell walls composed of cellulose and alginic acid (a substance similar to pectin).
The cellulose and alignic acid help to retain water and prevent seawood from drying out
when exposed to air at low tide.
Since phaeophytes live in a tidal environment, they have large, ﬂat fronds (a large leaf)
which can withstand pounding by waves. Their bases strongly anchor the algae to the rocky
seabed and prevent them from being washed out to sea. Phaeophytes are usually found in
areas of cold water.
22.11.3 Rhodophytes
Rhodophytes are typically found in warmer seawater, and are more delicate and smaller
than brown algae (phaeophytes). Rhodophytes are also able to grow at deeper depths in
the ocean, since red algae absorb green, violet, and blue light, the wavelengths of which
penetrate the deepest below the water surface. They also have mucilaginous material to
resist drying.
102Slime molds & Water molds
22.11.4 Chryosophytes
Chryosophytes are the most abundant unicellular algae in the oceans. They are also one
of the biggest components of plankton, a free-ﬂoating collection of microorganisms, eggs,
and larvae. As photosynthetic organisms, they produce a signiﬁcant amount of atmospheric
oxygen.
The reproduction cycle of chryosophytes is particularly interesting. Note that diatoms
reproduce both asexually and sexually. Since diatoms have a rigid cell wall with an outer
layer of silica (found in sand and glass), the daughter cells produced by mitosis must ﬁt
inside the original cell wall. Therefore, each generation of diatoms is smaller than the one
before. The reduction in size continues until the diatoms produce sexually, producing a
zygote which eventually grows to the original size as it matures.
22.11.5 Pyrrophytes
Pyrrophytes are unicellular, photosynthetic, and mostly aquatic. They have protective coats
composed of stiﬀ cellulose. They are more easily identiﬁable, due to the presence of two
ﬂagellae. The longer ﬂagellae propels the dinoﬂagellate, while the second shorter, ﬂatter
ﬂagellae functions as a rudder.
Some species of pyrrophytes are zooxanthellae. Since they lack cellulose plates, they make
their home in coral reefs and animals, such as sea anemones, and molluscs. In returning
the favour of sheltering them, dinoﬂagellates provide carbohydrates to their host through
photosynthesis. This is why there are nutrient-rich coral reefs in malnutritions water.
A negative aspect of pyrrophytes is that under certain conditions, species of dinoﬂagellates
reproduce rapidly to form a harmful algal bloom (HAB), known as a red tide if dinoﬂag-
ellates are the cause. Such pyrrophytes can produce toxins which may injure or kill wildlife,
and additionally any consumers of contaminated wildlife.
22.11.6 Euglenophytes
Like pyrrophytes, euglenophytes are small unicellular freshwater organisms with two ﬂagella.
They are mainly autotrophic or heterotrophic, depending if they have a red, light-sensitive
structure called an eyespot.
22.12 Slime molds & Water molds
There are two phyla of slime moulds and one phylum of water moulds.
22.12.1 Oomycotes (Water moulds)
Oomycotes are ﬁlamentous organisms which resemble fungi, in that they live as saprotrophs.
Oomycotes diﬀer from other moulds with the presence of spores and their sexual life cycle.
103Classiﬁcation of Living Things
22.12.2 Myxomycotes (Plasmodial slime moulds)
Myxomycotiesarevisibletothenakedeyeastinyslug-likeorganismswhichcreepoverdecayed
and dead matter. This streaming blob containing many nuclei is called a plasmodium.
22.12.3 Acrasiomycotes (Cellular slime moulds) and its reproductive
cycle
Acrasiomycotes exist as individual amoeboid cells with one nucleus each. When in un-
favourable conditions, each acrasiomycete cell gathers together to form a pseudoplasmod-
ium.

1. One acrasiomycete cell joins with others to form a pseudoplasmodium.
2. The pseudoplasmodium shrinks and forms a smaller plasmodium.
3. The plasmodium migrates to a suitable environment.
4. The plasmodium develops a sporangia, where original parental nuclei has divided by
meiosis into haploid spores to be germinated.
5. When favourable conditions arise, the spores germinate and are carried away by animals
or the wind.
6. Cycle repeats.

23.23 Introduction
Although you may not recognise fungi, they are just as prevalent as plants and animals.
Their spores are in the air which we breathe, fungi allow us to make bread, and mushrooms
(a type of fungi) are eaten by us. A few types of fungi are unicellular. For example, yeasts live
as individual oval or cylindrical cells. However, the majority of fungi live are multicellular.
Their bodies are composed of hyphae, a network of ﬁne ﬁlaments. In a mushroom, the
111Multicellular Photosynthetic Autotrophs
hyphae are densely packed so it is diﬃcult to see the individual structures when a mushroom
is eaten. However, a mushroom is only a specialised reproductive part of the whole fungus.
The main part of the fungi is underground in a whole web of hyphae, called a mycelium.
In the mycelium, each fungal cell is separated from each other by a septum. Each fungal
cell may have one or more nuclei and remains connected to the mycelium because the septa
are porous, allowing cytoplasm to ﬂow through the hyphae and fungal cell walls, made of a
hard material called chitin. Some fungi do not have septa, and they appear to be large,
branching, multinucleate cells.
23.24 Nutrition
Fungi are saprophytes. When they ﬁnd a source of food (e.g. dead wood, orange peel) ,
they decompose it and digest it. The enzymes break down larger organic molecules in the
substrate into smaller molecules. These smaller molecules diﬀuse into the fungus, where
they are used to allow growth and repair.
Fungi which feed on living cells are parasitic. For example, athlete's foot grows on the
human foot. These kinds of fungi produce hyphae called haustoria, which can penetrate
host cells without immediately killing them.
However, they are friendlier species of fungi. Many fungi live symbiotically with plants or
animals. For example, most trees have fungi living in close contact with their roots. In this
relationship, known as a mycorrhiza, there are many beneﬁts:
• Growing around the plant roots and often entering plant cells, the hyphae absorb minerals
from the soil and release them in the roots. The fungi gets its source of food (organic
nutrients) while delivering food to the plant.
• The mycelium here would increase the surface area, thus the absorptive surface, of the
plant roots.
• The fungal cells help to maintain air and water ﬂow in the soil around the roots.
• The fungi may prevent other potentially pathogenic fungi to attack the tree.
23.25 Fungal Reproduction
Fungi can reproduce in two ways. Firstly, they make asexually produce through frag-
mentation. This occurs when pieces of hyphae are broken oﬀ, which then grow into new
mycelia.
The second method is by spores. Spores are lightweight structures and windblown designed
to be transported over long distances and by many mediums, such as on the bodies of insects
and birds. They are additionally light enough to be blown away for hundreds of kilometers.
Spores may be asexual and sexual. Their sexual properties can be analysed to classify the
four phylla of fungi.
112Types of Fungi
23.26 Types of Fungi
23.26.1 Zygospore Fungi (Zygomycetes)
This phyllum includes bread moulds and other saprotrophs. Comparable to bacteria, this
phyllum prefers asexual reproduction over sexual reproduction.
1. Two haploid hyphae of opposite types, also known as mating strain + and mating
strain -, combine and fuse together.
2. Plasmogamy, the union of the two parent hyphae, occurs and results in the creation
of a heterokaryotic (n + n) zygosporangium or zygospore. Note that the zygospore is
NOT diploid yet; the haploid nuclei are simply clumped together.
3. Immediately, a thick wall develops around the zygospore to protect it from drying and
other hazards. The zygospore becomes dormant.
4. When conditions are favourable, the zygospore absorbs water and undergoes karyogamy
(n + n = 2n), where the haploid nuclei contributed by the two parents fuse to produce
diploid zygosporangia.
5. The now diploid zygosporangium then undergoes meiosis to form haploid sporangia.
6. Through asexual reproduction of fungi (See above for more information), the spores from
the sporangia germinate and grow into new mycelia.
7. Back to step #1.
23.26.2 Club Fungi (Basidiomycetes)
This phyllum increases mushrooms and shelf fungi. In many ways, the reproduction stages
of this phyllum is similar to that of zygomycetes.
1. Two haploid hyphae of opposite types, also known as mating strain + and mating
strain -, combine and fuse together.
2. Plasmogamy takes place, and a dikaryotic mycelium forms. The dikaryotic mycelium
grows faster then the haploid parental mycelia.
3. Environmental factors cause the dikaryotic mycelium to form compact masses which de-
velop into basidiocarps, short-lived reproductive structures. An example is the mushroom.
4. The basidiocarp gills are lined with terminal dikaryotic cells called basidia, which then
undergo karyogamy.
5. The basidia are now diploid. They undergo meiosis to develop haploid basidiospores, a
term referring to a basidiomycete's spores.
6. Stillremainingonthebasidiocarp, thehaploidbasidiosporeseject,fallfromthebasidiocarp,
and are dispersed by the wind when mature.
7. In a favourable environment, the basidiospores germinate and grow into short-lived
haploid mycelia.

23.27 Key Terms
synapomorphy
23.28 Introduction
What makes an animal an animal?
If animals are a monophyletic taxon, then animals should be able to be deﬁned by synapomor-
phies, (shared, derived characteristics). Ideally, we would NOT deﬁne this or any taxon using
symplesiomorphies (shared ancestral or primitive characteristics) or homoplastic characters
(the independent evolution of similarity, or "convergent evolution"). See pages 654 - 656 and
Fig. 32.6 in your text to review these concepts. As you consider the characteristics listed
below, ask yourself whether or not each is a synapomorphy.
23.29 Characteristics of an Animal
• There is no one universally accepted deﬁnition of an animal. The following treatment
follows your text, beginning on page 876.
• Animals:
• Are multicellular, heterotrophic eukaryotes ...
• Lack the distinctive cell walls of plants & fungi
• Share unique characteristics ...
• Share certain reproductive characteristics ...
• Other commonly used deﬁnitions ...
Animals are multicellular heterotrophic eukaryotes
• Unfortunately, none of these traits is exclusive to animals:
• Plants, fungi, and some algae are multicellular.
• Many bacteria, protists, and all fungi are heterotrophic.
• Everything other than bacteria and archaea are eukaryotic.
• Moreover, all three of these characteristics also apply to fungi.
• However, there is a diﬀerence here between animals and fungi. Animals generally
take in their food through ingestion, or eating and swallowing something. Fungi are
absorptive heterotrophs; they secrete their digestive enzymes onto their food, and then
absorb the resulting nutrients.
Animals share unique characteristics
• Only animals have muscle tissue and nervous tissue.
• Only animals have collagen, a structural protein
• Only animals have the following types of intercellular junctions: (See pages 135 - 139,
Figure 7.15 in your text for more information on these junctions.)
114Characteristics of an Animal
• Tight junctions (sealing function)
• Desmosomes (anchoring function)
• Gap junctions (communication function)
Animals share certain reproductive characteristics
• Most animals reproduce sexually, with the diploid stage dominating.
• In most animals, a small, haploid, ﬂagellated, motile sperm fertilizes a larger, haploid,
nonmotile egg to form a diploid zygote.
• Mitotic division of the zygote yields a blastula stage, followed by a gastrula stage. A
synapomorphy? This feature could be another "unique characteristic" shared by animals.
• Development may be direct to adult form, or there may be a sexually immature stage
(or stages) that are morphologically & ecologically distinct from the adult called a larva
(plural: larvae).
Other commonly used deﬁnitions or characterizations
• It is surprisingly diﬃcult to ﬁnd two texts that agree on a precise deﬁnition of an animal.
Here are a few perspectives from some other texts.
• Animals are multicellular eukaryotes; they are chemosynthetic heterotrophs that ingest
their food.
• Animals are motile, though many are secondarily sessile. Gametes usually are produced
inmulticellularsexorgans, andthezygotepassesthroughembryonicstagesthatinclude
a blastula.
• Animals are organisms that are multicellular, with more than one type of cell. They
are heterotrophic. They reproduce sexually (at least sometimes), with a zygote formed
from two diﬀerent haploid gametes. They go through a developmental stage called a
blastula.
• Animals are not photosynthetic, have no cell wall, and no hyphae or mycelia. (What
would a cladist think of this deﬁnition of the taxon Animalia?)
What kinds of animals are there?
• Kingdom Animalia generally is recognized to have approximately 30 phyla ...
• There is relatively little dispute over the number of phyla recognized; however, the
phylogenetic relationships among the phyla are hotly debated.
• Molecular techniques for assess similarity based on nucleotide sequences in nucleic
acids are providing valuable new perspectives on this question.
• Remember that two animals in diﬀerent phyla generally are considered to be more diﬀerent
from each other than are animals within one phylum (e.g., nematodes are more diﬀerent
from annelids than humans are from sharks).

23.31 Phylum Porifera
Figure 6 Sponges
Name means "pore-bearing".
This phylum consists of the sponges. The number of species is estimated to be between
5,000 and 10,000. All are aquatic and almost all are marine.
Animals in this phyla have no true tissues, which means, for example, that they have no
nervous system or sense organs. Although sponges are multicellular, they are described as
being essentially at a cellular level of organization. They are sessile as adults, but have a
free swimming larva.
Their bodies are porous. They are ﬁlter feeders; water ﬂows in through many small openings,
and out through fewer, large openings. They have inner and outer cell layers, and a variable
middle layer. The middle layer often is gelatinous with spiny skeletal elements (called
spicules) of silica or calcium carbonate, and ﬁbres made of spongin (a form of collagen).
117Multicellular Photosynthetic Autotrophs
Choanocytes are ﬂagellated cells lining the inside of the body that generate a current, and
trap and phagocytize food particles.
Their cells remain totipotent, or developmentally ﬂexible: they can become any type of
cell at any point in the sponge's development. This allows for the great regenerative power
sponges have.
Sponges are an ancient group, with fossils from the early Cambrian (ca. 540 mya) and
possibly from the Precambrian. Sponges often are abundant in reef ecosystems. They
somehow are protected from predators (spicules? bad taste?).
Many organisms are commensals of sponges, living inside them. Some sponges harbor
endosymbiotic cyanobacteria or algae (dinoﬂagellates, a.k.a. "zooxanthellae").
23.32 Phylum Cnidaria
See text pages 886 - 889.
Name comes from the Greek knide- meaning "nettle".
This phylum They have one opening, which serves as both mouth and anus. The body wall
has an outer ectoderm, an inner endoderm, and a variable undiﬀerentiated middle layer
called mesoglea or mesenchyme that may be jelly-like. The mesoglea is NOT considered
to be true mesoderm and so the Cnidaria are described as diploblastic. Tentacles usually
extend from the body wall around the mouth/anus.
118Phylum Cnidaria
Figure 7 Jellyﬁsh Development
14 15
There are two basic body plans: the polyp and the medusa . The polyp is sessile and
attaches to substrate by the aboral end (i.e., the end away from the mouth). The medusa
("jellyﬁsh") is a ﬂoating form, and looks like an upside-down version of the polyp. Some
cnidarians only have the polyp stage, some have only the medusa stage, and others have
both.
14 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polyp
15 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medusa%20%28biology%29
119Multicellular Photosynthetic Autotrophs
The typical life cycle of a cnidarian involves what is called "alternation of generations": an
alternation between an asexual polyp stage and a sexual medusa stage.
The tentacles are armed with cnidae (or nematocysts), small intracellular "harpoons" that
function in defense and prey capture. When ﬁred, the cnidae deliver a powerful toxin that
in some cases is dangerous to humans. The phylum is named after the cnidae.
Cnidarians have no head, no centralized nervous system, and no specialized organs for gas
exchange, excretion, or circulation. They do have a "nerve net."
Many cnidarians have intracellular algae living within them in a mutualistic symbiotic
relationship (Dinoﬂagellates = zooxanthellae). This combination is responsible for much of
the primary productivity of coral reefs.
There are three main classes in the phylum
16
• Class Hydrozoa (hydras and Portugese man-of-war are well-known but atypical examples
of this Class)
17
• Class Scyphozoa (jellyﬁsh)
• The medusa stage is dominant and the polyp stage often is reduced.
18
• Class Anthozoa (sea anemones, most corals)
• No medusa (jellyﬁsh) stage, so sexual reproduction occurs in the polyp stage in this
group. The polyps also can reproduce asexually, which is how individual "corals" grow.
23.33 Phylum Platyhelminthes
See text pages 890 - 893.
Name means "ﬂat worm"
Most members of this phylum are parasitic (ﬂukes and tapeworms), but some are free living
(e.g., planaria). There are about 20,000 species.
They are dorsoventrally compressed (i.e., "ﬂat").
Animals in this phylum are acoelomate, triploblastic, bilaterally symmetrical, and unseg-
mented. Platyhelminths have a simple anterior "brain" and a simple ladder-like nervous
system. Their gut has only one opening. Flatworms have NO circulatory or gas exchange
systems. They do have simple excretory/osmoregulatory structures (protonephridia or "ﬂame
cells").
Platyhelminths are hermaphroditic, and the parasitic species often have VERY complex
reproductive (life) cycles.
There are four main classes of platyhelminths:
19
• Class Turbellaria (mostly free living ﬂatworms, e.g., planaria)
16 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrozoa
17 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scyphozoa
18 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthozoa
19 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbellaria
120Phylum Rotifera
20
• Class Monogenea (parasitic ﬂukes)
21
• Class Trematoda (parasitic ﬂukes, e.g., liver ﬂuke and the human blood ﬂuke, Schisto-
soma)
22
• Class Cestoda (tapeworms)
• Cestodes are endoparasitic in the gut of vertebrates. They do not have a mouth or
digestive system.
23.34 Phylum Rotifera
See text page 900
The Rotifers. The name means "wheel bearing," a reference to the corona, a feeding structure
(see below).
They are triploblastic, bilaterally symmetrical, and unsegmented. They are considered
pseudocoelomates.
Most less than 2 mm, some as large as 2 - 3 mm.
Rotifers have a three part body: head, trunk foot. The head has a ciliary organ called the
corona that, when beating, looks like wheels turning, hence the name of the phylum. The
corona is a feeding structure that surrounds the animal's jaws. The gut is complete (i.e.,
mouth & anus), and regionally specialized. They have protonephridia but no specialized
circulatory or gas-exchange structures.
Most live in fresh water, a very few are marine or live in damp terrestrial habitats. They
typically are very abundant. There are about 2,000 species.
Parthenogenesis, where females produce more females from unfertilized but diploid eggs, is
common. Males may be absent (as in bdelloid rotifers) or reduced. When males are present,
sexual and asexual life cycles alternate. Males develop from unfertilized haploid eggs and
are haploid. Males produce sperm by mitosis which can fertilize haploid eggs, yielding a
diploid zygote that develops into a diploid female. Sexual reproduction occurs primarily
when living conditions are unfavorable.
Most structures in rotifers are syncytial ("a mulitnucleate mass of protoplasm not divided into
separate cells," or "a multinucleated cell") and show eutely (here, "constant or near-constant
number of nuclei").
23.35 Phylum Nematoda
See text pages 894 - 895.
Name from the Greek for "thread".
20 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monogenea
21 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trematoda
22 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cestoda
121Multicellular Photosynthetic Autotrophs
This phylum consists of the round worms. There are about 12,000 named species but the
true number probably is 10 - 100 times this!
These animals are triploblastic, bilaterally symmetrical, unsegmented pseudocoelomates.
They are vermiform, or wormlike.
In cross-section, they are round, and covered by a layered cuticle (remember this cuticle !!).
Probably due to this cuticle, juveniles in this phylum grow by molting. The gut is complete.
They have a unique excretory system but they lack special circulatory or gas-exchange
structures. The body has only longitudinal muscle ﬁbers. The sexes are separate.
Nematodes can be incredibly common, widespread, and of great medical and economic
importance. They are parasites of humans and our crops. They can live pretty much
anywhere.
In one rotting apple, there can be up to 90,000 nematodes, and in one tablespoon of coastal
mud, there can be 236 species of nematodes!
Nematodes can be free living or important parasites of our crops, or of humans and other
animals. They have become very important in development studies, especially the species
Caenorhabditis elegans, presumably due to its small size and constancy of cell number
(eutely - 959 cells in C. elegans).
23.36 Phylum Annelida
See text pages 906 - 909.
Name means "ringed", from the Greek annulatus.
This phylum consists of earthworms, leeches, and various marine worms given many diﬀerent
names (e.g., sand worms, tube worms). There are about 12,000 - 15,000 species.
Animals in this phylum are triploblastic, bilaterally symmetrical, segmented coelomates.
Development is typically protostomous. They have a complete circulatory system, and
a well-developed nervous system. Typically, each segment has paired epidermal "bristles"
(setae or chaetae).
Most are marine but they are successful occupants of almost anywhere suﬃcient water is
available. They can be free living, parasitic, mutualistic, or commensalistic.
Major advances of this phylum include the true coelom, segmentation, both longitundinal
and circular muscles, a closed circulatory system and, for most, a more advanced excretory
system (metanephridia).
There are three main classes of Annelids
• Class Oligochaeta (earthworms)
• Class Polychaeta (marine worms)
• Class Hirudinea (leeches)
122Phylum Arthropoda
23.37 Phylum Arthropoda
Figure 8 Arthropods
Name means "jointed feet".
This phylum consists of spiders, ticks, mites, insects, lobsters, crabs, and shrimp, and is the
largest of all the phyla. So far, over 1 million species have been named, and it is likely that
the true number out there is 10 - 100 times greater.
This phylum also includes the extinct trilobites, which were prevalent in the Paleozoic era.
Because of their exoskeletons, these animals fossilized well and over 4000 species have been
named.
These animals are triploblastic, bilaterally symmetrical, segmented, protostome coelomates.
The coelom is generally reduced to portions of the reproductive and excretory systems. They
have an open circulatory system.

in these organisms' locomotion, ﬂexibility, circulatory systems, gas exchange systems, and
growth. It also was partially responsible for the ability of the arthropods to move on to land.
There are several major groupings of arthropods:
Major subgroups include:
• The chelicerates (eurytperids, horseshoe crabs, scorpions, spiders, ticks) have clawlike
feeding appendages. They lack antennae and usually have simple eyes.
• The Trilobites...they get their own grouping
123Multicellular Photosynthetic Autotrophs
• The uniramians (centipedes, millipedes, insects) have one pair of antennae and un-
branched (uniramous) appendages.
• The crustaceans (crabs, shrimp, lobsters, barnacles and many others) have two pairs of
antennae and branched (biramous) appendages.
Major Classes Include
• Class Arachnida (mites, scorpions, spiders, ticks)
• Class Diplopoda (millipedes)
• Class Chilopoda (centipedes)
• Class Insecta (insects)
• Class Crustacea (crabs, crayﬁsh, lobsters, shrimp)
23.38 Phylum Mollusca
See text pages 900 - 905.
Name means "soft".
This phylum consists of snails, slugs, bivalves, chitons, squids, octopus, and many others.
About 110,000 species
All molluscs have a similar body plan:
• A muscular foot, usually used for movement.
• A visceral mass, containing most of the internal organs.
• A mantle, a fold of tissue that drapes over the visceral mass and secretes the shell, if
present.
• Most have a radula, or a rasping organ to scrape food.
Molluscs are bilaterally symmetrical, or secondarily asymmetrical. They are coelomates, but
the coelom generally has been greatly reduced; the main body cavity is a hemocoel. Devel-
opment is typically protostomous. The gut is complete with marked regional specialization.
Large, complex, metanephridia (excretion).
Many molluscan life cycles include a trochophore larva. This stage also is characteristic of
annelids.
There are several major classes of molluscs:
• Class Polyplacophora (chitons)
• Class Gastropoda (snails, slugs, nudibranchs)
• Class Bivalvia (clams, mussels, scallops, oysters)
• Class Cephalopoda (squids, octopuses, chambered nautiluses)
23.39 Phylum Echinodermata
Name means "spiny skin"
This phylum consists of sea stars, brittle stars, sea urchins, and sea cucumbers.
124Phylum Chordata
Echinoderms are mostly sessile or very slow moving animals.
As adults, they are radially symmetrical, but in the larval stage, they are bilaterally
symmetrical. They are considered deuterostomes.
Echinoderms are unique in that they have a water vascular system composed of a system
of ﬂuid-ﬁlled canals. These canals branch into the tube feet, which function in feeding,
locomotion, and gas exchange.
There are six major classes of echinoderms:
• Class Asteroidea (sea stars)
• Class Ophiuroidea (brittle stars)
• Class Echinoidea (sea urchins, sand dollars)
• Class Crinoidea (sea lilies)
• Class Holothuroidea (sea cucumbers)
23.40 Phylum Chordata
Name means "the chordates", i.e., these animals have a notochord at some stage in their
lifecycle.
This phylum consists of tunicates, lancelets, and the vertebrates.
There are four major features that characterize the phylum Chordata.
• A notochord, or a longitudinal, ﬂexible rod between the digestive tube and the nerve
cord. In most vertebrates, it is replaced developmentally by the vertebral column. This
is the structure for which the phylum is named.
• A dorsal hollow nerve cord which develops from a plate of ectoderm that rolls into a tube
located dorsal to the notochord. Other animal phyla have solid nerve cords ventrally
located. A chordate nerve cord splits into the central nervous system: the brain and
spinal cord.
• Pharyngeal slits, which allow water that enters through the mouth to exit without
continuing through the entire digestive tract. In many of the invertebrate chordates,
these function as suspension feeding devices; in vertebrates, they have been modiﬁed for
gas exchange, jaw support, hearing, and other functions.
• A muscular, postanal tail which extends posterior to the anus. The digestive tract of
most nonchordates extends the length of the body. In chordates, the tail has skeletal
elements and musculature, and can provide most of the propulsion in aquatic species.
Chordates have a segmented body plan, at least in development. This segmentation evolved
independently from the segmentation of annelids.
Three subphyla make up the phylum Chordata:
• Subphylum Urochordata (tunicates): the adults are enclosed in a tunic made of a carbo-
hydrate much like cellulose. They squirt water out of an excurrent siphon. Urochordates
are characterized by errant (mobile and active) larvae and sessile adults. All are ﬁlter
feeders. The only "chordate" characteristics retained in adult life are the pharyngeal slits.
125Multicellular Photosynthetic Autotrophs
Larval urochordates look more like adult cephlochordates & adult vertebrates than adult
urochordates.
• Subphylum Cephalochordata: Cephalochordates are known as lancelets because of their
blade-like shape; they are also known as amphioxus. They are marine animals and usually
live on the bottom, but can swim.
• Subphylum Vertebrata (vertebrates) ...
Formally, the phyla Urochordata and Cephalochordata are considered invertebrates.
23.40.1 Subphylum Vertebrata
Vertebrata refers to the presence of vertebrae and a vertebral column.
This subphylum includes most of the animals with which most people are familiar.
Vertebrates show extreme cephalization.
The notochord generally is replaced by the cranium & vertebral column in adults.
Neural Crest Cells
Later in development, these give rise to many cells of the body, including some cartilage
cells, pigment cells, neurons & glial cells of the peripheral nervous systems, much of the
cranium, and some of the cells of the endocrine system.
Some scientists would like to classify the neural crest as the fourth germ layer.
Neural crest cells come from the dorsal edge of the neural plate, thus ectoderm.
12624 Chordates
The phylum Chordata includes three subphyla. These include vertebrates and invertebrate
chordates.
24.1 Characteristics
Notochord: the rod-shaped supporting axis found in the dorsal part of the embryos of all
chordates, including vertebrates
Flexible, non-collapsible rod dorsal to the gut/coelom and below the nervous system,
hydrostatic, ﬂuid wrapped in tough connective tissue. As bone does not compact, muscles
tensed on one side result in movement instead of shortening the animal. This allows much
better locomotion than do cilia for larger animals in water, a crucial victory for later success.
Pharyngeal slits: Slits in the pharynx originally used to gather food, water enters the mouth,
passes through pharynx and out gill-like slits, passing through a cavity called an antrium
and then outside. In humans, present only in embryo.
Dorsal nerve cord: A neural tube dorsal to the notochord
Postanal tail: Elongation of the body and notochord, nerve cord and muscles past anus into
tail, early locomotive function led to success.
Non-synapomorphic characteristics (not limited to chordates):
• bisymmetrical (bilateral symmetry)
• segmented muscles and bones
24.2 Subphylum Urochordata
The tunicates are located in this subphylum. Along with the subphylum Cephalochordata,
these two subphyla make up the invertebrate chordates. Only the tunicate larvae have
notochords, nerve cords, and postanal tails. Most adult tunicates are sessile, ﬁlter-feeders
which retain their pharyngeal slits. Adult tunicates also develop a sac, called a tunic,
which gives tunicates their name. Cilia beating within the turnicate cause water to enter
the incurrent siphon. The water enters the body, passes through the pharyngeal slits,
and leaves the body through the excurrent siphon. Undigested food is removed through
the anus. Tunicates are hemaphrodites and can reproduce asexually through budding.In
urochordates notochord is conﬁned to larval tail.These lack cranium. These have an open
type of circulatory system.Excretion is by neural gland,nephrocytes.
127Chordates
24.3 Subphylum Cephalochordata
The lancelets are located in this subphylum. Along with the subphylum Urochordata, these
two subphyla make up the invertebrate chordates. Lancelets receive their name from their
bladelike shape. They resemble ﬁsh but they are actually scaleless chordates only a few
centimeters long. They spend most of their time buried in the sand with their mouths
protruding. Fossils of lancelets have been found to be over 550 million years old.
Dropped out sessile stage, what was the larval stage is now sexually reproductive. Includes
Branchiostoma (“amphioxus”).
24.4 Subphylum Vertebrata
(Vertebra from Latin vertere, to turn). Characterized by separate bones or cartilage blocks
ﬁrmly joined as a backbone. The backbone supports and protects a dorsal nerve cord.
Vertebrates have tissues which are organized into organs which in turn are organized into
organ systems.
All vertebrates share the following characteristics: - segmentation - a true coelom - bilateral
symmetry-cephalization-abackbone-abonyskull-aclosedcirculatorysystem-chambered
heart - two pairs of jointed appendages - tissues organized into organs
Vertebrate Organ Systems: - Nervous System - Circulatory System - Digestive System -
Respiratory System - Reproductive System - Excretory System
• Vertebral column: Not present in higher vertebrate adults. (In humans, the gel-like,
spongy core of the vertebral column is the only remainder. Ruptured or herniated disc is
an injury to this.)
• Cranium: Composite structure of bone/cartilage. Two functions: 1. Supports sensory
organs of head and 2. Encloses or partially encloses the brain.
What evolutionary relationship could we imagine between sessile echinoderms and the higher
chordate animals?
Paedomorphic (child-form) hypothesis: basically, evolution of sexual reproduction in what
had previously been a larval life stage, or the retention of at least one juvenile characteristic
into the adult (adult = sexually reproducing) stage. Some scientists believe that this occurred
in a proto-chordate animal lineage. Maybe chordates (and vertebrates) arose from sessile
(attached) ancestors. Selection in these proto-chordates maybe began to favor more time in
the larval stage, as feeding was more successful or mortality lower in this stage. As larvae
got bigger physics shows that the cilia become less eﬃcient for locomotion, favoring the
undulating motion allowed by a notochord.
Is this hypothesis crazy? A similar example of this today is Epemeroptera, the mayﬂy, which
has almost abandoned its adult stage. Its one-year lifespan is mostly larval with just a brief
day of reproduce-and-die as an adult, which doesn’t even have usable mouthparts.
Tunicate (sea squirt) larva has all four chordate characteristics, although adult sessile
(“attached”).
128Subphylum Vertebrata
24.4.1 Class Agnatha
"jawless ﬁsh"
• Ostracoderms: extinct Agnathans which had primitive ﬁns and massive plates of bony
tissue on their body.
• Cyclostomes: "circle mouth" - a group of Agnathans which is still alive in the form of
lampreys and hagﬁsh.
Appeared approximately 500 million years ago and dominated the oceans for about 100
million years. The ﬁrst group of ﬁsh to appear. They had neither jaws, paired ﬁns, nor
scales, but they were the ﬁrst organisms with a backbone.
Class Acanthodia
"spiny ﬁsh" Appeared about 430 million years ago. An extinct class of ﬁsh that developed
jaws with bony edges. They had internal skeletons made of cartilage and some bone.
Class Placodermi
Appeared about 410 million years ago, dominated the sea for about 50 million years. An
extinct class of ﬁsh with massive heads.
24.4.2 Class Chondrichthyes
"cartilaginous ﬁsh" Appeared about 400 million years ago with bony ﬁsh. Includes sharks,
skates and rays, and chimaeras. Their skeletons are made of cartilage strengthened by the
mineral calcium carbonate.
The main characteristics and distinguishing features of this class: - gills - single-loop blood
circulation - vertebral column - presence of placoid scales on their bodies - internal skeleton
of cartilage - paired, ﬂeshy pectoral and pelvic ﬁns - asymmetrical tail ﬁn prevents sinking -
fatty liver provides neutral buoyancy - visceral clefts present as separate and distinct gills -
no external ear - oviparous - internal fertilization - ectoderms - cold blooded
24.4.3 Class Osteichthyes
"bony ﬁsh" Appeared about 400 million years ago with cartilaginous ﬁsh. Includes about
95% of today's ﬁsh species.
Subclass Sarcopterygii
ﬂeshy-ﬁnned ﬁshes. Fins have bones and muscles, homologous to our limbs.
Order Dipnoi
lung ﬁshes, two groups isolated when continents separated
129Chordates
Order Crossopterygii
includes coelacanths and rhipodistians, gave rise to amphibians, had lungs which evolved
into a swim bladder in bony ﬁshes, and labyrinthodont teeth, characterized by complex
folding of enamel.
• Skeleton made of bone, jaws, ﬁns, most with scales, two-chambered heart.
24.4.4 Class Amphibia
means “both lives”, aquatic larvae, terrestrial adult Amphibians: - Legs - Lungs - Double-
Loop Circulation - Partially Divided Heart - Cutaneous Respiration (Breathes through
Skin)
Order Salientia
frogs (jumping) (aka Anura)
Order Urodela
salamanders (tailed)
Labyrinthodont amphibians: oldest known amphibians, inherited characteristic teeth from
crossopterygii ancestor, had stocky, aquatic larvae.
Amphibians have limbs instead of ﬁns. Girdles and vertebral column now more substantial
and connected, support body on legs.
Lisamphybia: no scales, “smooth”, eggs with no shell, laid in water (water-reliant).
Amphibians gave rise to cotylosaurs, from which arose dinosaurs, turtles, lizards, and
therapsids.
Class Reptilia
amniotic egg allowed freedom from water, shelled egg. (Amnion: protection). Reptiles have
four extra-embryonic membranes:
• Amnion: supports aquatic environment inside egg in ﬂuid sac.
• Allantois: allows gas exchange and elimination of wastes.
• Chorion: gas exchange
• Yolk sac: only one of the four left over from amphibian ancestor
Reptiles cold-blooded, or ectothermic, meaning that their heat come from their environment.
Sometimes deﬁned as all amniotes that are not birds or mammals.
Reptiles can be classiﬁed by skull structure into four groups:
• Anapsid
• Synapsid
• Diapsid
• Euryasid
130Subphylum Vertebrata
Refers to number of holes in the skull. Cotylosaurs had Anapsid skull
Dermatocranium: from bony outer skull structure, precursor to human cranium.
Subclass Anapsidia
Subclass Testudinata
1
turtles , terrapins
Subclass Diapsida
2 3
dinosaurs , snakes , most stuﬀ
Subclass Synapsida
Order Therapsids
Subclass Diapsida
includes Ichthyosaurs, marine reptiles convergent on dolphins; Plesiosaurs, ancient sea
monsters; Squamates, including lizards and snakes; and Thecodonts, which gave rise to
• birds
• dinosaurs
• crocodilians
Dinosaurs: broken into two groups, based on hip structure
• Saurischia: lizard hips (gave rise to birds [!]), ancestrally bipedal
• Ornithischian: bird hips, ancestrally quadripedal
Crocodilians: come from archosaurs, the only extant (still living today) archosaur descendant.
Ancestrally bipedal, secondarily quadripedal.
Synapsids: refers to joined (Greek syn-, together with) parts of skull. Led eventually to
mammals. Synapsid pelycosaur >> therapsid >> mammals
Pelycosaur: Sail-backed dinosaur, legs not spread out like lizard but more pillar-like and
under body, allowing greater activity and competence in motion, pendulum like rather than
constant push-up. Teeth diﬀerentiated into diﬀerent types, for pre-processing of food needed
by higher metabolism. Skull changes, bone histology, suggestions of warm-bloodedness.

131Chordates
Class Aves
arose late Jurassic, early Cretaceous. Feathers, skeleton modiﬁed for ﬂight. Feathers:
epidermal derivative, made of keratin (like ﬁngernails). Carpometacarpis: bears primary
ﬂight feathers, parallel to hand parts. Keeled sternum: breastbone, powerful one needed
to support ﬂight muscles. Strong, light, occasionally hollow bones. All birds lay eggs (as
contrasted to reptiles, which have developed live birthing over 100 independent times.) Why
are there no live-bearing birds? Early birds had teeth, lost them. With mammals, only
exothermic animals.
Archaeopteryx: “ancient wing”, Jurassic bird-reptile, very dinosaur-like. Good fossils found
in Zolenhoﬀen, German sandstone mine with ﬁne sand, shows feathers clearly, found shortly
after Darwin’s publication and used to support his hypothesis. Thick, heavy bones and no
sternum, bony tail, not a good ﬂyer but did have primary ﬂight feathers.
Archaeornithes: includes archaeopteryx.
Paleognathae: gave rise to Australian ﬂightless birds.
Neognathae: remaining live birds.
Class Mammalia
Two unique characteristics, or synapomorphies:
• Hair
• Mammary glands
(don’t fossilize well)
Three skeletal characteristics (fossilize)
• Lower jaw only one bone, the dentary (several in reptiles)
• Three bones in middle ear: malleus, incus, stapes (reptiles have one or two, never three)
• Joint between upper and lower jaws between dentary and squamosal of skull (in reptiles
this joint is between other bones)
Mammals basically have a synapsid skull design inherited from ancestor
Non diagnostic characteristics (not unique to mammals):
• Warm-blooded
• Skin glands: sweat glands and oil-producing sebaceous glands
• Large nasal cavities (because of high metabolism) Clean, warm and humidify air
• Heterodonty (diﬀerentiated teeth)
• Diphiodonty: two sets of teeth: baby and adult (“deciduous” teeth, drop out) (reptile
teeth are continually replaced)
Subclass Protheria
monotremes (Greek mon-, one; and trema, hole), or egg-laying mammals, have one opening
for excretion and urination.
132Subphylum Vertebrata
Subclass Theria
Metatheria: Marsupials (opossum, kangaroo...) Eutheria: Placental mammals (all common
mammals)
Marsupium: (from Greek marsypion, purse or pouch). Gestation period much shorter than
in Eutherian mammals, but after leaving the uterus the tiny oﬀspring crawls into a pouch
where it completes development latched onto a teat.
Recent molecular (read: genetic) evidence suggests that two diﬀerent mammal groups
may have developed live-bearing ability separately. Instead of being a “rough draft” for
placental-style live bearing, perhaps the marsupial pouch approach is another solution to
the same problem. Advantage: in tough times the parent can pitch out the oﬀspring and
increase its own chance of survival.
13325 Tissues and Systems
13526 Epithelial tissue
Comes from various sources, ectodermal or endodermal material. Cell sheet lines a
surface or body cavity. One side, called freesurface or Apical, is exposed to
• animal interior (forming the lumen) or
• exterior of its body cavity.
The other side rests on the basal layer.
Epithelial tissue is not penetrated by blood vessels.
Two categories:
• sheets
• glands
Classiﬁed on two features:
• simple, (a single layer of cells),
• stratiﬁed, (more than one cell layer.)
Cell shape at free surface:
• squamous (broad and ﬂat)
• cuboidal (spherish)
• columnar (tall and thin)
Simple squamous epithelium
usually lines body cavities and vessels,alveoli, glomeruli of kidney; in blood and lymph
vessels called endothelium; in body cavities called mesothelium (serosae): parietal serous
membranes line body wall, visceral serous membranes cover organ
Simple cuboidal epithelium
in ducts like kidney and salivary glands.
Simple columnar epithelium
nonciliated type lines digestive tract, ciliated type lines some regions of uterine tubes and
lungs
Stratiﬁed squamous epithelium
(important) lines mouth, esophagus,and vagina. Cells sometimes dead, ﬂat and keratinized,
making them resistant to abrasion. Stratiﬁed squamous epithelium changes to columnar
squamous epithelium progressively down esophagus to the stomach.
Epidermis
137Epithelial tissue
from epithelium. Below this is dermis, thicker and with blood vessels.
Two specialized epithelia:
• pseudostratiﬁed
• transitional
Pseudostratiﬁed epithelia
lines the trachea (where it is ciliated)and the male urethra (where it is non ciliated), looks
stratiﬁed but not.
Transitional epithelia
found only in bladder and urinary system. As it stretches it appears to go from 6 to 3 cell
layers deep.
Glandular epithelia
(gland: group of cells that excretes something.. mostly derived from epithelium. Glands
are classiﬁed into endocrine and exocrine by where they excrete.
Endocrine glands
secrete hormones into the blood without use of ducts.
Exocrine glands
secrete onto the body surface or into a cavity, thru a duct. Exocrine substances include
sweat, mucous, oil, and saliva. An exocrine gland is the liver, which secretes bile.
13827 Connective tissue
This is a “grab bag” category of diverse tissue types. Functions include binding and
supporting. Types include bone, cartilage, ﬁbrous connective tissue, blood and
adipose (fat) tissue.
If you took away everything in the body except the connective tissue, you’d still be able to
see the basic form of the body.
Form: distinctivecellssurroundedbyacellmatrixmadeofextra-cellularﬁbergrounded
in a ground substance (excluding blood)
Types:
1. connectile connective tissues (can be 1. loose or 2. dense)
2. special connective tissue (includes blood, bones and cartilage).
Fibroblasts form connective tissue proper;
chondoroblasts form cartilage;
osteoblasts form bone;
and blood is formed from various sources.
Ground substance: “unstructured” material that ﬁlls space between cells and contains
ﬁbers. Made of
1. interstitial ﬂuid (bathes cells)
2. proteoglycans (protein core with attached polysaccharides, glycoaminoglycans or GAGs
such as chondroitin sulfate, keratin sulfate, and hyalronic acid, whose consistency is syrupy
to gelatin-like)
3. cell-adhesion proteins (connect connective tissue cells to the ﬁbers).
Fibers of connective tissue:
139Connective tissue
1. Collagen (ﬂexible protein resistant to stretching, tensile strength, most abundant
protein in animals, white)
2. elastin (rubbery, resilient protein, in dermis, lungs, blood vessels, yellow when fresh)
3. andreticulin (like collagen).
Loose connective tissue: found beneath skin, anchors muscles,nerves etc. Include ﬁ-
broblasts, macrophages, mast cells,and adipose cells. Fibers include collagen and
elastic ﬁbers. Ground substance is “syrupy”. Adipose included.
Dense connective tissue: largely densely packed ﬁbers of collagen or elastin regularly
or irregularly arranged. Forms tendons and ligaments, coverings of muscles, capsules
around organs and joints, and dermis of skin.
Cartilage vs. bone
Feature Bone Cartilage
cell type osteocytes chondrocytes
ground substance calcium phosphate chondroitin sulfate
vascularization vascular avascular
micro architecture highly ordered less organized
units called osteons
ﬁbrous sheath peristeum perichondrium
Cartilage: There are three cartilage types:
1. hyaline cartilage
2. ﬁbrocartilage (ﬁbrous cartilage)
3. elastic cartilage
Hyaline cartilage: most widespread cartilage type, in adults forms articular surfaces of
long bones, rib tips, rings of trachea, and parts of skull. Mostly collagen, name refers to
glassy appearance. In embryo, bones form ﬁrst as hyaline cartilage, later ossiﬁes. Found
in tracheal rings. Few collagen ﬁbers.
Fibrous cartilage: have lots of collagen ﬁbers. Found in intervertebral discs, pubic
symphesis. Grades into dense tendon and ligament tissue.
Elastic cartilage: springy and elastic. Found in internal support of external ear and in
epiglottis, yellow when fresh.
Chondrocites (cartilage cells) rely on diﬀusion for nutrients, as cartilage has no direct
blood supply, and no enervation (nerves). Can be loaded with calcium salts.
140Subphylum Vertebrata
Bone: Specialized connective tissue, calcium phosphate arranged in highly ordered unit
called osteon, or Hyvercian system. Concentric rings around central canal with blood
vessels and enervation (nerves). Bone varied, not all vertebrate bone is even cellular. Our
concern: simple pattern for mammals.
Lacuna (spaces in which osteocytes found); canaliculi (little canals) bigger diagonal cells,
layers of bone called lamellae.
Three types of bone cells, ending in
-blast, (mend bone)
-cyte (fortify bone)
-clast (tear down bone)
Classiﬁed by
1. appearance (spongy vs. hard)
2. where found (outside or inside)
3. how it is formed (endochondral cartilage model forms ﬁrst and then is ossiﬁed, and
entramembranous, bone forms directly without cartilage precursor)
Example of endochondral bone formation: long bone begins to ossify from center shaft,
calciﬁed region expands and cuts oﬀ diﬀusion of nutrients as bone replaces cartilage. In
young mammals, secondary ossiﬁcation centers then form at bone ends, growth has stopped
by sexual maturity as all primary bone is ossiﬁed. In other animals, bones continue growing
throughout their lifetime.
Three types of intramembrous bone:
1. dermal bone
2. sessamoid bone
3. perichondral bone.
Dermal bone forms skull, shoulder/pectoral girdle, and integument, descended from dermal
armor of ancestor. Comes from mesoderm, in dermis of skin.
Sessamoid bones: form directly in tendons. Example: kneecap, also in wrist. Deals with
stress.
Perichondral bone means “around cartilage,” forms around cartilage or bone. Func-
tions in bone repair and in ossiﬁcation of endochondral bone.
141Connective tissue
Bone remodeling and repair: bone has mineral structure, and develops tiny fractures,
which, under stress, can lead to larger fractures. To combat this, bone is constantly replaced.
Osteoclasts channel through existing bone, tear down and leave behind osteoblasts
and lacuna, leaving osteocytes. Continually resets mineral structure of bone, and is
preventative maintenance.
When bone broken, callus forms in open ends, periosteum gives rise to new bone with
calcium and new bone matrix, leaves irregular mend. Later, osteoblasts continue ﬁxing over
time and slowly removing imperfection.
14228 Muscle tissue
Mesodermal in origin, muscle has several functions: supply force for movement,restrain
movement, proper posture, act on viscera (internal organs) for peristalsis (moving food
down digestive tract), give body shape, form sphincters, (such as in esophagus, between
stomach and intestine, large and small intestine, in anus), in sheets of muscles, aﬀect air
ﬂow in and out of lungs, line blood vessels and play vital role in circulation.
Secondary roles: heat production (shivering a specialized heat production to supplement
metabolism).
Muscles co-opted to other non-original functions: sharks detect electrical ﬁeld created by ﬁsh
muscles. Some ﬁsh formed electric organs, create current strong enough to repel predators
or stun prey. Other ﬁsh can use ﬁeld as “radar” to see things and communicate with other
animals. (Evolved independently in diﬀerent groups).
Diﬀerent classiﬁcations: by color, (red or white) location, nature of nervous system
control (voluntary or involuntary), embryonic origin, or by general microscopic ap-
pearance (striated, smooth, and cardiac.)
Striated muscle (or skeletal muscle): under voluntary control. Individual cells called
ﬁbers, grouped into fascicle. Myoﬁbrils founding one cell made of even smaller myoﬁl-
aments. Each striated cell very long and multi-nucleated. Fibers joined end to end to
form longer composite ﬁbers. Sarcomeres: repeating units make up myoﬁbrils. Two
kinds of myoﬁlaments, thick kind made up of myosin and thin of actin. Striations visible
in light microscope, smaller part only with electron microscope.
Cardiac muscle: occurs only in heart. Light banding visible under light microscope.
Each band short, principally mononucleate (occasionally dinucleate) often branched, joined
together with intercollated discs. Involuntary. Waves of contraction spread through intercol-
lated discs. Initiated by nerve stimulation or can originate in the heart itself (useful in heart
transplants.)
Smooth muscle: no striations visible with light microscope. Almost entirely visceral
function: digestion, sphincters, urogenital tracts, piloerectory muscles (make hairs stand up),
lungs. Non-voluntary control. Slow and sustained action. Each cell mononucleate, short,
fusiform (spindly) in shape, cells usually uniform in size.
Striated muscle contraction: Muscle broken into units called fascicles, in units of myoﬁbrils.
Repeating units called sarcomeres, consisting of two kinds of myoﬁlaments:
1. thick, myosin ﬁlament
2. thin, actin ﬁlament.
143Muscle tissue
Sarcomere: Thick and thin ﬁlaments interspersed in ordered grid.
Sliding ﬁlament theory: thick and thin ﬁlaments move past each other in opposite
direction, shortening length. Longer muscles contract more rapidly than short ones (see cell
bio for details).
Myosin molecule: two polypeptides twisted together with two globular heads at end.
Myosin ﬁlament: many slender myosin molecules together.
Actin ﬁlament: chain of actin single, tropomyosin strands with repeated globular
troponin, and with actin. All play role in muscle contraction. Myocin heads have sites
that bind to actin. Actin ﬁlaments have many regular sites that can bind to myosin.
Troponin has four sites:
1. one to bind myosin
2. one for actin
3. one for tropomyocin
4. one for calcium ions
Nerve signal reaches muscle, triggers release of chemical signal called neurotransmitter,
that diﬀuses across cell membrane (sarcolimic reticulum) and binds to receptors in it.
Receptor is acetylcholine, ACH. When there is enough nerve signal, the message travels
through t-line to sarcoplasmic reticulum to release calcium ions.
Lacking calcium, tropomyosin site blocked. In calcium, myosin binding sites exposed and
heads bind to actin molecules, delivering force to move ﬁbers in relation to each other.
Myocin head then interacts with ATP to get “recocked”, if myosin still exposed then it
ﬁres again and results in further muscle contration. If there is no further nerve signal,
sarcoplasmic reticulum sequesters Ca+ ions again and no recocking occurs.
Quirari (or curare): known from movies, used in South America, blocks acetylcholine
receptors in cell and causes skeletal paralysis. Victim dies of asphyxiation because he can’t
breathe.
Duchenne's muscular dystrophy: degeneration of sarcolema, plasma membrane of
muscle cell unable to release signal and quickly atrophies.
Fast and slow twitch ﬁbers: vertebrate muscle ﬁber. Terms relative within one group
of animals. Diﬀerences related to diﬀerences in enervation, type of myocin, and actin
activation.
Two parts of force generated by muscle: 1. active component 2. elastic component (energy
stored in muscle when stretched by gravity or another force. Stored in muscle elastic tissue
around tendons. Especially important in limb oscillation, like running, or trunk twisting,
like ﬁsh swimming. Up to 90% of stored elastic energy can be recovered.)
144Subphylum Vertebrata
How does a muscle match its power to its job? Two ways:
1. rate modulation, derived from frequency of nervous stimulation of muscle, force
increases as frequency of stimulation increases up to point of tetanus.
2. selective involvement of motor units, a given neuron enervates a ﬁxed number of
muscle cells, (a motor unit), and force is increased by recruiting more motor units. Motor
units may be small, such as in eye, or larger, like in leg muscle.
How do muscles grow stronger?
1. add more myoﬁlaments, increases cross sectional area by up to 50%, more little ratchets
working
2. proliferation in blood vessels and connective tissue around muscle
Muscle strength is relative to cross sectional area, not length. Not always feasible to add
more cross sectional area.
Pinnate ﬁbers: oriented obliquely (Y-shaped) to minimize muscle mass, in certain circum-
stances, like calf muscle. Spreads muscle out.
Velocity of shortening greater in long muscle than short. Why? Contraction tied to relation
between ﬁbers, and to total length of muscle. Both long and short muscles reach same
percentage of contraction in same unit time, but distance covered by the longer muscle is
greater.
Synergist muscles: muscles work together to produce motion in same general direction.
Bicep shares work with brachialis.
Antagonist muscles: muscles that oppose each other. Bicep pulls forearm in, triceps pulls
it back out.
Origin vs. insertion: origin is the end of the muscle that more ﬁxed in its attachment to
the body. The more movable end called insertion.
Fixators: muscles that act to stabilize a joint or lever system. Like upper arm when you
clench your ﬁst hard.
Flexors and extensors: applied mainly to limbs. Flexor bends one part relative to another
about limb, extensor straightens it.
Adductor and abductor: adductor draws a limb toward the ventral surface. Abductor
moves limb away from ventral surface. (Adduct: drawn toward; abduct: carry away).
14529 Vertebrate digestive system
Functions to break down food into molecules small enough to absorb, or pass across digestive
membrane.
Digestive tract: tube extending from lips of mouth to anus or cloacae in bird, reptile or
monotreme.
Lumanal glands: empty into inner body cavity (lumen: inner surface).
Tract divided into three main regions: 1. buccal cavity 2. pharynx 3. alimentary canal
Alimentary canal divided into four regions: 1. esophagus 2. stomach 3. small intestine 4.
large intestine
Accessory digestive glands, outside digestive tract proper, secrete into lumen of tract
through ducts. Includes the salivary glands, liver and pancreas.
Buccalcavity, whichincludespalateandtongue, developsfrominfoldingofstomadeum,
or second opening of blastula, whereas the rest of the digestive tract develops from the
primitive gut.
Teeth: capture and hold prey. In mammals in particular further process and break down
food into small particles, increasing surface area available for enzymatic action.
Tooth anatomy: 1. crown projects above gum, 2. root below gum, 3. enamel is outer
coating of crown, hardest surface in body, of epideral origin 4. dentin, below enamel,
bone-like and forms bulk of tooth, is harder than bone and contains nerves and blood vessels.
(Remember that mammals are heterodontic, with diﬀerent types of teeth).
Pharynx: air passage for adult, gill slits in embryo. Important in lower vertebrates, site of
gills. Features derived from pharyngeal region: ﬁrst pharyngeal pouch gives rise to parts
of the ear, other pouches give rise to various other structures.
Alimentary canal: epithelium lines lumen, glands secrete into lumen, longitudinal and
circular muscles help digestive movements (peristalsis).
Esophagus: tube carries food from mouth to stomach. Expands to ﬁt large bolus (lump
of chewed food). Secretes mucus for lubrication. Birds have crop for storage, enlargement
of esophagus.
Epiglottis: keeps food out of air tube, an evolutionary “kludge,” or ﬁx.
Stomach. Absorbs water, alcohol, nutrients, uses gastric juice with enzymes, mucous, HCl,
released by chief and parietal cells (release protein enzymes) in gastric pits. Rugae: folds
of stomach, disappear when full. Sphincter at both ends of stomach, control food passage.
Chyme: semi-digested food released to small intestine.
147Vertebrate digestive system
Small intestine: three regions, duodenum, jejunum, and ileum.
Duodenum site of most intestinal digestion. Jejunum and ileum do most of intestinal
absorption. Ileum ends with another sphincter, ileocolic valve or ileosecal valve. Structure:
Circular folds covered with villi (singular is villus).
Villi: ﬁnger-likecellular projections, covered withmicrovilli, tinyprojectionswhichincrease
surfacearea. Increasessurfaceareaby900x, speedsdigestion(breakdown)andabsorption
(taking in nutrients).
Large intestine: larger diameter, shorter length than small intestine. No villi. In mammals,
forms large gentle loop, colon, empties into straight region, rectum, empties into outside
world through anal sphincter. Colon: absorbs water left over, also absorbs vitamins released
by bacteria which live there (vitamin K).
Food: made up of 1. proteins, 2. fats, 3. carbohydrates 4. ﬁbrous material.
Digestive system breaks foods down. Proteins must be broken to amino acids to be
absorbed. Polysaccharides to monosaccharides, lipids to fatty acids and monoglyc-
erides to absorb.
Salivary glands in mouth, saliva contains mucous, salt and a few enzymes (amalase, begins
starch breakdown). Snake venom from oral gland, mixture of toxins and digestive enzymes.
Breaks down blood vessels and disables nervous system.
Stomach enzymes: released in inactive form, zymogene, converts to active form in lumen
of gut. Transformation is triggered by another enzyme, or the stomach’s low pH. Pepsin
secreted as pepsinogen (-ogen means primitive form). Stomach glands secrete up to two or
three liters a day of gastric juice, which is reabsorbed.
Chyme released to duodenum.
Small intestine has two major accessory glands: 1. pancreas 2. liver
Pancreas has endocrine and exocrine functions, releases large amounts of carbonate to
neutralize acidic chyme, as intestinal enzymes work in neutral pH, and stuﬀ to break down
lipids and starch (zymogens, like tripsin)
Liver releases bile. Bile made from cholesterol, stored in gall bladder, released in
duodenum, emulsiﬁes fats.
Emulsify: keeps fats in tiny drops, which are suspended, increasing surface area and action
of lipases. Protein and carbohydrates absorbed in intestine, taken to liver for processing.
Fatty acids go to lymphatic system
Appendix: vestigial remnant. Much variation in digestive systems within mammals:
herbivore, carnivore, insectivore, non-ruminant herbivore.
Rumen: four-chambered stomach of animals like cows (ruminant herbivores). Cellulose
resistant to digestion, rely on microorganisms to break down cellulose. Some bacteria,
protists and fungi can break down cellulose, almost no animals can. Bacteria break down
cellulose in rumen, to be taken back to the mouth to chew their cud (ruminate). Later cow
swallows to proceed with digestion. (Horses not like this).
148Subphylum Vertebrata
Coprophagy: rabbits and other animals eat their own feces for the nutritious products of
the cecum.
14930 Circulatory system
Circulatory system functions
1. Transportation
a. Respiration: gas exchange (O2 and CO2), overcomes limited rate
of
diﬀusion
b. Nutrition:<br>
c. Excretory: (remove metabolic wastes)<br>
2. Regulation
a. Transport hormones<br>
b. Regulate body temperature<br>
c. Protection<br>
i. Blood clotting<br>
ii. Immune system (carries white blood cells)
Vasodilation: allows heat loss across epidermis, as seen in elephant ears, takes more blood
to surface of body, sweating may accompany
Countercurrent heat exchange: used by dolphins in ﬁns to conserve heat in cold water.
Veins surround an artery, and blood returning to body absorbs heat from blood traveling
out from body to ﬁn, minimizing heat loss. Used by dogs in feet, etc.
Blood made of 1. plasma and 2. formed cellular elements (red and white blood cells,
and platelets).
Plasma makes up 55% of blood volume. Cellular elements make up the other 45%.
Plasma makeup: 90% water, 7-8% soluble proteins (albumin maintains blood osmotic
integrity, others clot, etc.) 1% electrolytes 1% elements in transit
Red blood cell (erythrocyte): contains hemoglobin, functions in oxygen transport. In
mammals, red blood cells lose nuclei on maturation, and take on biconcave, dimpled, shape.
No self repair, live 120 days. About 1000x more red blood cells than white blood cells.
About 7-8 micrometers in diameter.
151Circulatory system
Hematocrit: proportion of blood volume that is occupied by cells, about 43% in humans
on average. 48% for men and 38% for women.
White blood cells (leukocytes): Nucleated, about 10-14 micrometers in diameter, com-
monly amoeboid, escape circulatory system in capillary beds. Include basophils, eosinophils,
neutrophils, monocytes, B- and T-cell lymphocytes.
Platelets (thrombocytes) Membrane bound cell fragments in mammals, no nucleus. In
non-mammals, platelet role replaced by nucleated cells. Accumulate at site of broken blood
vessels, form clots. Bud oﬀ special cells in bone marrow. 1-2 micrometers in diameter. 7-8
day life span, 1/10 or 1/20 as abundant as white blood cells.
Arteries: carry blood away from heart. Smallest tubes called arterioles, feed blood to
capillaries.
Veins: return blood to heart. Smallest veins called venules.
Structure of arteries and veins, listed from inside (lumen) out: 1. epithelium (endothelium),
2. elastic connective tissue ﬁbers, 3. smooth muscle, 4. connective tissue. Arteries
have thicker elastic layer than do veins.
Capillaries, where exchange of materials occurs, are very thin and narrow, and red blood
cells pass through single ﬁle. Capillaries are tiny but numerous, and their total volume is
greater than that of supplying arteries.
Blood velocity drops in capillaries, picks back up in veins. Pressure highest in arteries, lower
in capillaries and arteries.
Osmotic pressure draws interstitial ﬂuid from blood in arterioles, but replaces it in venules.
One-way valves mean that blood can ﬂow only one way, works with residual blood pressure
and compression by skeletal muscles. Low pressure in thoracic cavity caused by breathing
also helps move blood.
Lymphatic system: part of the immune system, a one-way, or open, system. Takes up
interstitial ﬂuid not taken up by venules.
Lymphatic structures:
1. lymphatic capillaries
2. lymphatic vesicles
3. lymph nodes
4. lymphatic organs (spleen and thymus)
Lymph: movement in mammals through one-way valves, similar to blood movement in
veins. (Some non-mammals have lymphatic hearts of unknown embryonic origin. Frogs and
salamanders have several.) Lymph rejoins cardiovascular system into a large vein near the
heart via single large thoracic duct.
152Subphylum Vertebrata
As lymph passes through system, passes lymphocytes, second part of immune system.
Heart: pumps blood, design varies between animals. In adult mammal,four chambers form
two separate circulations
1. pulmonary circulation to and from lungs and
2. systemic circulation to and from tissues of body.
Everything in the heart comes in pairs: 2 atria, 2 ventricles (left and right).
Diagrams usually drawn as though animal were on its back.
Pattern of blood ﬂow through heart: blood returning from major veins (vena cava)
enters rightatrium, contraction there delivers blood to rightventricle through atricuspid
valve, one of atrial ventricular valves (AV valve). Contraction of right ventricle drives blood
through semi lunar valve into pulmonary circuit and to lungs.Blood return to heart in
pulmonary veins, is oxygenated. Goes to left atrium, which contracts and delivers blood
to left ventricleby way of aortic semi-lunar valve, then goes to systemic circulation.
Both atria and ventricles contract in unison, left is more powerful than right (to all system
vs. just lungs).
Systole: heart contraction, diastole: heart relaxed
Timing of heart contraction: ventricles rebound to relaxed shape (diastole), and semi-
lunar valves close. Both atria(singular: atrium) ﬁll with blood coming from pulmonary
and systemic circulations.Pressure rises in the atria and blood begins to move into the
ventricles.The atria then contract, forcing more blood into the ventricles. There is a pause,
then ventricles contract. This raises ventricle pressure, atrio-ventricular(AV) valves
shut and semi-lunar valves open, forcing blood from the left ventricle into the major arteries
and from the right ventricle into the aorta.
Control for this action doesn’t rely on nervous stimulation, has intrinsic rhythmicity, called
myogenic. This is the case in mammal as well as in mollusk hearts. Other animals have
neurogenic hearts that rely on nervous stimulation for heart action, originating in the
cardiac ganglion.
The rhythmicity of mammalian heart relies on the sino-atrial (SA)node, or pacemaker.
This is a phylogenic (based on evolutionary history) remnant of an early vertebrate heart
that had one more chamber than modern hearts.
How the heart contracts: waves of depolarization start in SA node and spread
through atria. Connectile tissue pauses the spread of depolarization at the atrial ventricular
node. Signal continued by bundle branches to lower ventricle, begins to stimulate
heart to contract. Contraction starts at bottom of heart at heart apex,then signals spread
through heart.
Medulla (in the brain) controls autonomic nervous system. (The medulla is part of
the brain, is continuous with the spinal cord, and controls involuntary actions of the
body). Sympatheticcardiacacceleratorconnectstospinalcord, usesnorepinephrine
to signal. Parasympathetic cardio-inhibitory center reaches heart through Vagus
153Circulatory system
nerve, usesacetylcholine to signal. Hyperpolarizes membrane to inhibit heart contraction.
(Autonomic nervous system: two parts working in contra to control from both sides.)
Dominant eﬀect here is inhibitory. If we cut Vagus nerve, heart rate promptly rises about
25 bpm.
15431 Respiratory system
In humans and other animals, for example, the anatomical features of the respiratory system
include airways, lungs, and the respiratory muscles.
Other animals, such as insects, have respiratory systems with very simple anatomical features,
and in amphibians even the skin plays a vital role in gas exchange.
Plants also have respiratory systems but the directionality of gas exchange can be opposite
to that in animals. The respiratory system in plants also includes anatomical features such
as holes on the undersides of leaves known as stomata.
In mammals, the diaphragm divides the body cavity into the
abdominal cavity: contains the viscera (e.g., stomach and intestines)
thoracic cavity: contains the heart and lungs.
Respiratory tree: terminates in alveolus, alveoli. Respiratory bronchioles branch into
alveolar ducts and into alveoli. Alveolus: microscopic air sacs, 300 million of these in human
lungs. Total surface area large. Gas diﬀuses micrometer, very tiny distance.
Nervous System
Composed of tissues designed to integrate sensory information and direct a coordinated
response to the environment.
1
Basic unit of the nervous system is the neuron , a highly specialized cell that uses both
electrical and chemical processes to communicate. Neurons "listen" to sensory organs or
other neurons, and can simultaneously "hear" from 1 to hundreds of inputs simultaneously.
Likewise, a neuron can "talk" to other neurons or cells that can create an action, like muscle
cells or glands.
Neurons are outnumbered in the nervous system by glia. Glia were once thought to only play
a supportive role in helping neurons survive; today we know that they also are important
participants in the communication process. Glial cells include astrocytes, ependymal cells,
and a cell that has a macrophage like function. There are also oligodendocytes and Schwann
cells that provide a myelin sheath.
1 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron
155Respiratory system
31.1 Neuron structure
Figure 9 Neuron
• Dendrite will receive information from other axons
• Stoma is the neuron body and contains typical cell parts including the mitochondria and
nucleus. This is where neurotransmitters are synthesized.
• Axon hillock is where the cell body and the axon meet.
• Axon is surrounded by myelin.
• Contains nodes of Ranvier
Types of axons include unipolar, bipolar, pseudopolar.
Action potentials results from excitatory stimuli received from the dendrites that results
in a signal that travels down the axon. On the cellular level, there is a Na+ inﬂux via
channels causing a depolarization of the cell. Once those channels close, the slower opening
K+ channels will open resulting in hyperpolarization by the cell.
Synapses
Neurotransmitters allow a chemical signal to be sent from one neuron to the other. Neuro-
transmitters must bypass a physical gap called the synapse. Examples of neurotransmitters
include acetylcholine, epinephrine, and glutamate.
Example : Neuromuscular synapses
156Central nervous system
Circuits / Nuclei / Ganglia
31.2 Central nervous system
Central nervous system includes the brain and the spinal cord.
Brain There are four lobes of the brain.
• Frontal lobe - decision making
• Parietal lobe
• Temporal lobe
• Occipital lobe - vision
The areas of the brain are also dedicated to diﬀerent functions.
• Precentral gyrus
• Postcentral gyrus
Protection The CNS is protected by three layers - the pia mater, the arachnoid mater, and
the dura mater. Protection also comes from the circulation of cerebral spinal ﬂuid (CSF).
CSF helps to ﬂoat the brain and also provide nutrients to both the brain and the spinal
cord. CSF is synthesized from the choroid plexus of the lateral ventricles. In total, there are
four ventricles - 2 lateral ventricles, a 3rd, and 4th ventricle.
31.3 Peripheral nervous system
The peripheral nervous system is broken down into two sub-systems, the somatic nervous
system and the autonomic nervous system.
ANS - Autonomic Nervous System The ANS has two components - parasympathetic and
sympathetic.
The sympathetic nervous system is the "ﬁght or ﬂight" or fright response and results in an
increased heart rate, increased rate of breathing, and an elevated blood glucose level. There
is also decreased digestion. The second neurotransmitter is epinephrine. In this case, the
ﬁrst neuron is short and the second neuron is long.
The parasympathetic nervous system is the rest and digest system.
Drugs must be able to pass the blood brain barrier to have an eﬀect on the CNS. Drugs act
by aﬀecting the neuron and how likely it is to ﬁre an action potential.
Stroke occurs when there is a blood clot that goes to the brain and prevent blood ﬂow.
15732 Sensory systems
Categorized by
1. nature of stimulus, such as mechanical, chemicalor light stimulus, and
2. where stimulus received, such as outside (exteroceptors,such as the eye and
skin temp receptors) or insidebody (interoceptors, such as blood body tem-
perature receptors).
Transduction of sensory input into signal. Means to “carry across”,signal transduced, or
carried, from environment into nervous signal.
Three sensory processes we cover
1. taste and smell (chemoreception)
2. gravity and movement
3. light
32.1 Taste and smell (chemoreception)
Found in mammal nose and mouth, ﬂy feet, ﬁsh bodies, moth antennae.
Papilla: bumps on tongue, contain taste buds down between. Sweet, sour, salty and bitter.
Some act directly by ion channels, others act indirectly. Other “taste” sensations really
smell.
Smell: received in nasopharynx. Airborne molecules go into solution on moist epithelial
surface of nasal passage. Approximately 1000 genescode for sensory neuron receptors. “Fried
onions” odor not one receptor but a mixture of many odors registered in our mind as one.
Very sensitive, habituates rapidly (don’t notice a smell after a bit). Odor sensation has
relatively unﬁltered root to higher brain centers.
Snakes more chemosensory focused than us.
32.2 Response to gravity and movement
Registered in inner ear. Three semicircular canals loop in three planes at right angles
to each other, responsible for transduction of movement messages. Method: hair cells
159Sensory systems
deformed by gelatinous membrane. Vestibular apparatus, gives us perception of gravity
and movement. Due to physical response, not chemical binding.
Cochlea: bony, coil shaped part of inner ear, where hearing occurs.
Sound enters throughauditory canal, vibratestympanic membrane,moving three bones
of middle ear (malleus, incus, and stapes)against oval window opening in front of cochlea.
Cochlea has three ﬂuid ﬁlled ducts, one of these the organ of Corti. Sound waves in air
go to vibration in organ of Corti; ﬂuid tickles hair cells, which register the movement
along basilar membrane in cochlea. Diﬀerent sound frequencies move diﬀerent portions
of basilar membrane. Hearing loss due to loss of hair cells.Humans normally smell more
than 300 odors in a day(Facts and Truth).
Transduction of sound accomplished throgh physical deformation,not chemical binding.
32.3 Vision
Light enters pupil, focused by lensonto retina.
Sclera: hardened part behind retina.
Optic nerves and neurons attached to retina. Blind spot where optic nerve attaches, has
no receptors.
Two types of photoreceptors
1. rods - black and white low-light vision, 100 million in each retina in humans.
2. cones - color vision, work best under better illumination. 3 million in each retina.
Fovia: region of most acute vision, has most of the cones, few rods.
Transduction process of light to signal a molecular change, to light absorbing molecule
called photopigment. Located in outer parts of rods and cones in pigment discs. The rod
photopigment is called rhodopsin,cone has three photopigments, called photopsins. This
molecular change initiates pathways to result in action potential in downstream neuron
leading to vision center in brain.Parul Godika
Each of the three photopsins has a diﬀerent peak of sensitivity: blue,green or red, and
changes isometric form (from cisto trans) based on light from a particular wavelength
range. Color blindness:inherited lack of one or more types of these cones. Gene carried on X
chromosome, therefore more common in men than women.
32.4 Homeostasis
Is a very important part of everyone's and everything's lives. Deﬁned as dynamic con-
stancy of internal environment, maintenance of a relatively stable environment inside
an organism usually involving feedback regulation.
160Osmotic environments and regulations
Homeostasis is maintained in face of
1. a varying external environment, or
2. a non-ideal, constant external environment (as with the penguin).
Deals with temperature, pH, chemical concentrations,pressure, oxygen levels.
Occurs through negative feedback loops.
Various forms: simple thermostat in house turns oﬀ heater when above a certain temperature
and on when below a certain temperature Involves stimulus, sensor,integrating center,
eﬀector and response.
More eﬃcient control has two sensors and two eﬀectors. Can be antagonistic to each
other, such as, one cools, the other heats.
Precise control through proportional control, not all-or-none, furnace comes on a little
bit if the house a bit cold. Examples in humans: vasoconstriction, change in metabolic rate,
shivering. Physiological responses for high body temp: blood goes to body surface, sweating,
behavioral changes (get out of sun).
Positive feedback loop: eﬀector increases deviation from set point. Ampliﬁes reaction.
Like blood clotting process, uterine contraction during childbirth. Negative feedback must
exist at some point for control.
32.5 Osmotic environments and regulations
1. Marine invertebrates
a) fully marine invertebrates (not intertidal or estuarine) osmoconformers (set
internal environment same as environment, no net ﬂow of ions) in a stenohaline
(narrow non-changing salt level) environment
b) Coastal, intertidal, estuarine (ion levels ﬂuctuate) invertebrates.Partly osmo-
confomers, partly osmoregulators in a euryhaline (wide salt level variation)
environment (ex: shore crab, regulates sometimes when salt levels in environment
get real low).
2. Freshwater animals. Here, environment has lower solute concentrations than do
living organisms so water tends to ﬂow in and solutes out.
a) Freshwater ﬁsh (bony) dilute urine, and gills actively take up ions (NaCl)
b) Freshwater invertebrates: same situation as freshwater ﬁsh but with diﬀerent
structures
c) Freshwater amphibians: active uptake of salts across their skin
3. Marine ﬁshes: Here the environment has a higher solute concentration than does
the organism so water tends to ﬂow out and ions in.
a) Bony ﬁshes: actively secrete salts (NaCl) across gills, absorb water across gut
wall, their kidney (unlike mammalian kidney) is unable to generate concentrated
urine so glomerulus is reduced, active tubular secretion of MgSO
4
b) cartilaginous ﬁshes (and coelacanth): blood retains urea and trimethylamineoxide
to increase its osmolality to that of seawater
161Sensory systems
4. Terrestrial animals: here problem is loss of water to a drier environment, and
regulation of salt levels.
a) water loss adaptations
b) concentrated exception of salts and nitrogenous wastes
Hypoosmotic: having less osmotic potential than nearby ﬂuid
Hyperosmotic: having more osmotic potential than nearby ﬂuid
Isoosmotic: having equal osmotic potential than nearby ﬂuid
Glomerulus: reduces volume of kidney
Fish started in salt water, spread to fresh water, later reinvaded salt-water environment.
Terrestrial animal water sources:
1. drinking
2. moist foods
3. from breakdown of metabolic molecules like fats. (Desert kangaroo rats get 90% of their
water from metabolism.)
Secretion of nitrogenous wastes: from metabolism of amino acids, amino group has to be
removed in one of three basically interchangeable chemical forms:
1. ammonia (aquatic life)
2. urea (mammals)
3. uric acid (birds)
Ammonia very toxic, soluble, and cheap to produce. Easy to expel for bony ﬁshes.
Urea: low toxicity, good solubility, more costly to lose as it contains other groups on it.
Must be released in solution, water cost.
Uric acid (white part of bird poo) low toxicity, insoluble, secreted with little water loss,
more costly side groups lost than the others.
Mammalian kidney: Structure: ﬁst-sized organ in lower back. About 1/5 of blood from
aorta at any time is passing through kidneys. Blood passes through kidney many times a
day.
Nephron: structural and functional unit of kidney.
Bowmans capsule: funnel-like opening, contains primary ﬁlter, the glomerulus.
Proximal convoluted tubule: receives stuﬀ from Bowmans capsule.
Loop of Henle: descends and ascends.
162Osmotic environments and regulations
Vasa recta: capillaries that surround the Loop of Henle.
Glomerulus: main ﬁlter of the nephron, located within the Bowman's capsule
Kidney properties and processes important to its function
1. Active transport of solutes from one ﬂuid to another against a concentration gradient,
+
Na actively transported out of ﬁltrate by cells of the thick ascending loop of Henley into
the interstitial ﬂuid
2. Passive movement of solutes and water from one ﬂuid to another(down a concen-
tration gradient), movement of water and NaCl out of descending loop of Henley into
interstitial ﬂuid.
3. Diﬀerential permeability of cells in diﬀerent regions of the nephron to movement
of water and solutes, ascending thick look is impermeable to water, descending portion is
permeable to water
4. Hormonal control of that permeability, antidiuretic hormone(ADH) increases
permeability of collecting due to water, resulting in reduced volume of ﬁltrate and thus
more concentrated urine.
5. Increasing solute concentration in the interstitial ﬂuid of the kidney, from the
cortex to the deepest medulla, maintained by a countercurrent multiplier mechanism

11 Getting Started
32 Biology - The Life Science
The word biology means, "the science of life", from the Greek bios, life, and logos, word
or knowledge. Therefore, Biology is the science of Living Things. That is why Biology is
sometimes known as Life Science.
1
The science has been divided into many subdisciplines, such as botany , bacteriology,
2 3
anatomy , zoology, histology, mycology, embryology, parasitology, genetics , molecular biol-
4 5 6 7
ogy , systematics, immunology, microbiology , physiology, cell biology , cytology, ecology ,
and virology. Other branches of science include or are comprised in part of biology studies,
8
including paleontology , taxonomy, evolution, phycology, helimentology, protozoology, en-
tomology, biochemistry, biophysics, biomathematics, bio engineering, bio climatology and
anthropology.
2.1 Characteristics of life
Not all scientists agree on the deﬁnition of just what makes up life. Various characteristics
describe most living things. However, with most of the characteristics listed below we can
think of one or more examples that would seem to break the rule, with something nonliving
being classiﬁed as living or something living classiﬁed as nonliving. Therefore we are careful
not to be too dogmatic in our attempt to explain which things are living or nonliving.
• Living things are composed of matter structured in an orderly way where simple
molecules are ordered together into much larger macromolecules.
An easy way to remember this is GRIMNERD C All organisms; - Grow, Respire, Interact,
Move, Need Nutrients, Excrete (Waste), Reproduce,Death, Cells (Made of)
• Living things are sensitive, meaning they are able to respond to stimuli.
• Living things are able to grow, develop, and reproduce.
• Living things are able to adapt over time by the process of natural selection.
9
• All known living things use the hereditary molecule, DNA .

5Biology - The Life Science
• Internal functions are coordinated and regulated so that the internal environment of a
10
living thing is relatively constant, referred to as homeostasis .
11
Living things are organized in the microscopic level from atoms up to cells . Atoms are
12 13
arranged into molecules, then into macromolecules , which make up organelles , which
work together to form cells. Beyond this, cells are organized in higher levels to form entire
14
multicellular organisms. Cells together form tissues , which make up organs, which are
part of organ systems, which work together to form an entire organism. Of course, beyond
this, organisms form populations which make up parts of an ecosystem. All of the Earth's
ecosystems together form the diverse environment that is the earth.
Example:-
sub atoms, atoms, molecules, cells, tissues, organs, organ systems, organisms, population,
community, eco systems
2.2 Nature of science
Science is a methodology for learning about the world. It involves the application
of knowledge.
The scientiﬁc method deals with systematic investigation, reproducible results, the
formation and testing of hypotheses, and reasoning.
Reasoning can be broken down into two categories, induction (speciﬁc data is used to
develop a generalized observation or conclusion) and deduction (general information leads
to speciﬁc conclusion). Most reasoning in science is done through induction.
Science as we now know it arose as a discipline in the 17th century.
2.3 Scientiﬁc method
The scientiﬁc method is not a step by step, linear process. It is an intuitive process, a
methodology for learning about the world through the application of knowledge. Scientists
must be able to have an "imaginative preconception" of what the truth is. Scientists will
often observe and then hypothesize the reason why a phenomenon occurred. They use all
of their knowledge and a bit of imagination, all in an attempt to uncover something that
might be true. A typical scientiﬁc investigation might go like so:
You observe that a room appears dark, and you ponder why the room is dark. In an attempt
to ﬁnd explanations to this curiosity, your mind unravels several diﬀerent hypotheses. One
hypothesis might state that the lights are turned oﬀ. Another hunch might be that the
room's lightbulb has burnt out. Worst yet, you could be going blind. To discover the truth,
10 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/homeostasis
11 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cell
12 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/macromolecule
13 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/organelle
14 http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/General%20Biology%2FTissues
6Scientiﬁc method
you experiment. You feel your way around the room and ﬁnd a light switch and turn it on.
No light. You repeat the experiment, ﬂicking the switch back and forth. Still nothing. That
means your initial hypothesis, the room is dark because the lights are oﬀ, has been rejected.
You devise more experiments to test your hypotheses, utilizing a ﬂashlight to prove that
you are indeed not blind. In order to accept your last remaining hypothesis as the truth,
you could predict that changing the light bulb will ﬁx the problem. If all your predictions
succeed, the original hypothesis is valid and is accepted. In some cases, however, your
predictions will not occur, in which you'll have to start over. Perhaps the power is oﬀ.
Figure 1 How Science is Done
A diagram that illustrates scientiﬁc investigation
Scientists ﬁrst make observations that raise a particular question. In order to explain the
observed phenomenon, they develop a number of possible explanations, or hypotheses. This
is the inductive part of science, observing and constructing plausible arguments for why
7Biology - The Life Science
an event occurred. Experiments are then used to eliminate one of more of the possible
hypotheses until one hypothesis remains. Using deduction, scientists use the principles of
their hypothesis to make predictions, and then test to make sure that their predictions are
conﬁrmed. After many trials (repeatability) and all predictions have been conﬁrmed, the
hypothesis then may become a theory.
Quick Deﬁnitions
Observation - Quantitative and qualitative measurements of the world.
Inference - Deriving new knowledge based upon old knowledge.
Hypotheses - A suggested explanation.
Rejected Hypothesis - An explanation that has been ruled out through experimentation.
Accepted Hypothesis - An explanation that has not been ruled out through excessive
experimentation and makes veriﬁable predictions that are true.
Experiment - A test that is used to rule out a hypothesis or validate something already
known.
Scientiﬁc Method - The process of scientiﬁc investigation.
Theory - A widely accepted hypothesis that stands the test of time. Often tested, and
usually never rejected.
The scientiﬁc method is based primarily on the testing of hypotheses by experimentation.
This involves acontrol, or subject that does not undergo the process in question. A scientist
will also seek to limit variables to one or another very small number, single or minimum
number of variables. The procedure is to form a hypothesis or prediction about what you
believe or expect to see and then do everything you can to violate that, or falsify the
hypotheses. Although this may seem unintuitive, the process serves to establish more ﬁrmly
what is and what is not true.
A founding principle in science is a lack of absolute truth: the accepted explanation is the
most likely and is the basis for further hypotheses as well as for falsiﬁcation. All knowledge
has its relative uncertainty.
Theories are hypotheses which have withstood repeated attempts at falsiﬁcation. Common
theories include evolution by natural selection and the idea that all organisms consist of
cells. The scientiﬁc community asserts that much more evidence supports these two ideas
than contradicts them.
8Charles Darwin
2.4 Charles Darwin
Figure 2
Charles Darwin is most remembered today for his contribution of the theory of evolution
through natural selection.
The seeds of this theory were planted in Darwin's mind through observations made on a
ﬁve-year voyage through the New World on a ship called the Beagle. There, he studied
fossils and the geological record, geographic distribution of organisms, the uniqueness and
relatedness of island life forms, and the aﬃnity of island forms to mainland forms.
Upon his return to England, Darwin pondered over his observations and concluded that
evolution must occur through natural selection. He declined, however, to publish his work
because of its controversial nature. However, when another scientist, Wallace, reached similar
conclusions, Darwin was convinced to publish his observations in 1859. His hypothesis
revolutionized biology and has yet to be falsiﬁed by empirical data collected by mainstream
scientists.
2.5 After Darwin
Since Darwin's day, scientists have amassed a more complete fossil record, including
microorganisms and chemical fossils. These fossils have supported and added subtleties
to Darwin's theories. However, the age of the Earth is now held to be much older than
Darwin thought. Researchers have also uncovered some of the preliminary mysteries of
the mechanism of heredity as carried out through genetics and DNA, areas unknown to
Darwin. Another growing area is comparative anatomy including homology and analogy.
Today we can see a bit of evolutionary history in the development of embryos, as certain
(although not all) aspects of development recapitulate evolutionary history.
9Biology - The Life Science
15
The molecular biology study of slowly mutating genes reveal considerable evolutionary
history consistent with fossil and anatomical record.
2.6 Challenges to Darwin
Figure 3
Darwin and his theories have been challenged many times in the last 150 years. The
challenges have been primarily religious based on a perceived conﬂict with the preconceived
notion of creationism. Many of those who challenge Darwin have been adherents to the
young earth hypothesis that says that the Earth is only some 6000 years old and that all
species were individually created by a god. Some of the proponents of these theories have
suggested that chemical and physical laws that exist today were diﬀerent or nonexistent in
earlier ages. However, for the most part, these theories are either not scientiﬁcally testable
and fall outside the area of attention of the ﬁeld of biology, or have been disproved by one
or more ﬁelds of science.

185 Life: History and Origin
5.1 Properties of life
1. Organization: Being structurally composed of one or more cells, which are the basic
units of life.
• prokaryote: no nucleus
• eukaryote: membrane bound nucleus.
2. Sensitivity: respond to stimuli.
3. Energy Processing
4. Growth and Development
5. Reproduction
• hereditary mechanisms to make more of self; DNA based.
6. Regulation, including homeostasis.
7. Evolution.
5.2 Origin of life: 3 hypotheses
• Extraterrestrial origin (panspermia): meteor, comet borne from elsewhere in universe
• evidence of amino acids and other organic material in space (but often both D & L
forms)
• questionable bacterial fossils in Martian rock
-However, this would imply that some other origin of life was likely because it would have
had to happen elsewhere before it could be transported here, and the only diﬀerence would
be that life did not originate on Earth.
• Spontaneous origin on earth: primitive self-replicating macromolecules acted upon by
natural selection ((macro)Evolution is one example of this)
-This is often attacked for the seeming impossibility for life to have been produced by a
chemical reaction triggered by lightning and the ability of any produced DNA to actually be
in a sequence that could produce a working model of life if replicated. It is also attacked
for religious reasons, as it bypasses things like the idea of a supreme being directly creating
humans. It also seems unlikely to some that such huge changes are possible in evolution
19Life: History and Origin
without evidence of an "in-between stage" that is credible. Many of the stages of man are
disputed due to their somewhat shakey grounds. For example, bones from other animals
have been taken accidentally in some cases to be part of a humanoid, and complete skeletons
have been sketched out from a limited number of bones.
• Special creation: religious explanations (Intelligent Design is one popular example of
this.) These explanations contend that life was created by God (or perhaps some other
Intelligent Designer).
• Proponents of Intelligent design suggest that the vast complexity of life could only
have been intentionally designed while other creationists cite biblical support.
-This is often attacked for many of the same reasons that religion is attacked, and is often
regarded as superstitious and/or unscientiﬁc.
• It is debated as to whether schools should teach one hypothesis or the other when talking
about the origin of life. However, since they are all currently known major hypotheses
(and sometimes hypotheses proven wrong are shown for educational purposes), this
wikibook includes what it can without discriminating unfairly against one hypothesis or
the other.
5.3 The early earth
It is believed that the Earth was formed about 4.5 billion years ago.
• Heavy bombardment by rubble ceased about 3.8 billion years ago.
• Reducing atmosphere: much free H
• also H O, NH , CH
2 3 4
• little, if any, free O
2
• with numerous H electrons, require little energy to form organic compounds with C
• Warm oceans, estimated at 49-88°C
• Lack of O and consequent ozone (O ) meant considerable UV energy
2 3
Chemical reactions on early earth
• UV and other energy sources would promote chemical reactions and formation of organic
molecules
• Testable hypothesis: Miller-Urey experiment
• simulated early atmospheric conditions
• found amino acids, sugars, etc., building blocks of life
• won Nobel prize for work
• experiment showed prebiotic synthesis of biological molecules was possible
Issues
• Miller later conceded that the conditions in his experiments were not representative of
what is currently thought to be those of early earth
• He also conceded that science has no answer for how amino acids could self-organize into
replicating molecules and cells
• In the 50 years since Miller-Urey, signiﬁcant issues and problems for biogenesis have been
identiﬁed. This is a weak hypothesis at this time.
20Origin of cells
• Conclusion: Life exists, we don't know why.
5.4 Origin of cells
Cells are very small and decompose quickly after death. As such, fossils of the earliest cells
do not exist. Scientists have had to form a variety of theories on how cells (and hence life)
was created on Earth.
• Bubble hypothesis
• A. Oparin, J.B.S. Haldane, 1930’s
• Primary abiogenesis: life as consequence of geochemical processes
• Protobionts: isolated collections of organic material enclosed in hydrophobic bubbles
• Numerous variants: microspheres, protocells, protobionts, micelles, liposomes, coacer-
vates
• Other surfaces for evolution of life
• deep sea thermal vents
• ice crystals
• clay surfaces
• tidal pools
5.5 The RNA world?
• DNA→ RNA→ polypeptide (protein)
• Catalytic RNA: ribozyme
• discovered independently by Tom Cech and Sid Altman (Nobel prize)
• catalytic properties: hydrolysis, polymerization, peptide bond formation, etc.
• Self-replicating RNA molecule may have given rise to life
• consistent with numerous roles for RNA in cells as well as roles for ribonucleotides
(ATP)
• relationship to bubble-like structures is uncertain
5.6 The earliest cells
• Microfossils
• ˜3.5 by
• resemble bacteria: prokaryotes
• biochemical residues
• stromatolites
• Archaebacteria (more properly Archaea)
• extremophiles: salt, acid, alkali, heat, methanogens
• may not represent most ancient life
• Eubacteria
• cyanobacteria: photosynthesis
• atmospheric O ; limestone deposits
2
21Life: History and Origin
• chloroplasts of eukaryotes
Cyanobacteria
5.7 Major steps in evolution of life
• Prebiotic synthesis of macromolecules
• Self replication
• RNA? (primitive metabolism)
• DNA as hereditary material
• 1st cells
• Photosynthesis
• Aerobic respiration
• Multicellularity (more than once)

226 Cells
237 Cell structure
7.1 What is a cell?
The word cell comes from the Latin word "cella", meaning "small room", and it was ﬁrst
coined by a microscopist observing the structure of cork. The cell is the basic unit of all
living things, and all organisms are composed of one or more cells. Cells are so basic and
critical to the study of life, in fact, that they are often referred to as "the building blocks of
life". Organisms - bacteria, amoebae and yeasts, for example - may consist of as few as one
cell, while a typical human body contains about a trillion cells.
According to Cell Theory, ﬁrst proposed by Schleiden and Schwann in 1839, all life consists
of cells. The theory also states that all cells come from previously living cells, all vital
functions (chemical reactions) of organisms are carried out inside of cells, and that cells
contain necessary hereditary information to carry out necessary functions and replicate
themselves.
All cells contain:
1
• Lipid bilayer boundary (plasma membrane )
2
• Cytoplasm
3
• DNA (hereditary information)
4
• Ribosomes for protein synthesis
Eukaryotic cells also contain:
5
• At least one nucleus
6
• Mitochondria for cell respiration and energy
Cells may also contain:
7
• Lysosomes
8
• Peroxisomes
9
• Vacuoles
10
• Cell walls

25Cell structure
7.1.1 Concepts
Plasma Membrane
Phospholipid bilayer, which contains great amount of proteins, the most important functions
are the following:
1. It selectively isolates the content of the cell of the external atmosphere.
2. It regulates the interchange of substances between the cytoplasm and the environment.
3. Communicates with other cells.
Model of the ﬂuid mosaic
Describes the structure of the plasma membrane, this model was developed in 1972 by
cellular biologists J. Singer and L. Nicholson.
Phospholipid bilayer
Is in the plasma membrane and produces the ﬂuid part of membranes.
Proteins
Long chains of amino acids.
Glucose proteins
Proteins together with carbohydrates in the plasma membrane, mostly in the outer parts
of the cell.
Functions of proteins
Transport oxygen, they are components of hair and nails, and allow the cell interact with
its environment.
Transport Proteins
Regulate the movement of soluble water molecules, through the plasma membrane. Some
transport proteins called channel proteins form pores or channels in the membrane so
that water soluble molecules pass.
Carrying proteins
Have union sites that can hold speciﬁc molecules.
Reception proteins

Rudolf Virchow
Zoologist, who proposed the postulates of the cellular theory, observes that the living cells
could grow and be in two places at the same time, he proposed that all the cells come from
other equal cells and proposed 3 postulates:
1. Every living organism is formed from one or more cells
2. The smallest organisms are unicellular and these in turn are the functional units of
the multicellular organisms.
3. All the cells come from preexisting cells.

28History of cell knowledge
7.2 History of cell knowledge
The optical microscope was ﬁrst invented in 17th century. Shortly thereafter scientists began
to examine living and dead biological tissues in order to better understand the science of
life. Some of the most relevant discovery milestones of the time period include:
11
• The invention of the microscope , which allowed scientists for the ﬁrst time to see
biological cells
12
• Robert Hooke in 1665 looked at cork under a microscope and described what he called
cork "cells"
13
• Anton van Leeuwenhoek called the single-celled organisms that he saw under the
microscope "animalcules"
14
• Matthias Jakob Schleiden , a botanist, in 1838 determined that all plants consist of
cells
15
• Theodor Schwann , a zoologist, in 1839 determined that all animals consist of cells
16
• Rudolf Virchow proposed the theory that all cells arise from previously existing cells
In 1838, the botanist Matthias Jakob Schleiden and the physiologist Theodor Schwann
discovered that both plant cells and animal cells had nuclei. Based on their observations,
the two scientists conceived of the hypothesis that all living things were composed of cells.
In 1839, Schwann published 'Microscopic Investigations on the Accordance in the Structure
and Growth of Plants and Animals', which contained the ﬁrst statement of their joint cell
theory.
7.2.1 Cell Theory
Schleiden and Schwann proposed spontaneous generation as the method for cell origination,
17
but spontaneous generation (also called abiogenesis ) was later disproven. Rudolf Virchow
famously stated "Omnis cellula e cellula"... "All cells only arise from pre-existing cells." The
parts of the theory that did not have to do with the origin of cells, however, held up to
scientiﬁc scrutiny and are widely agreed upon by the scientiﬁc community today.
The generally accepted portions of the modern Cell Theory are as follows: (1) The cell is the
fundamental unit of structure and function in living things. (2) All organisms are made up
of one or more cells. (3) Cells arise from other cells through cellular division. (4) Cells carry
genetic material passed to daughter cells during cellular division. (5) All cells are essentially
the same in chemical composition. (6) Energy ﬂow (metabolism and biochemistry) occurs
within cells.

7.3 Microscopes
• Allow greater resolution, can see ﬁner detail
• Eye: resolution of ˜ 100 μm
18
• Light microscope : resolution of ˜ 200 nm
• Limited to cells are larger organelles within cells
19
• Confocal microscopy : 2 dimension view
20
• Electron microscope : resolution of ˜0.2 nm
• Laser tweezers: move cell contents
7.4 Cell size
One may wonder why all cells are so small. If being able to store nutrients is beneﬁcial
to the cell, how come there are no animals existing in nature with huge cells? Physical
limitations prevent this from occurring. A cell must be able to diﬀuse gases and nutrients in
and out of the cell. A cell's surface area does not increase as quickly as its volume, and as a
result a large cell may require more input of a substance or output of a substance than it
is reasonably able to perform. Worse, the distance between two points within the cell can
be large enough that regions of the cell would have trouble communicating, and it takes a
relatively long time for substances to travel across the cell.
That is not to say large cells don't exist. They are, once again, less eﬃcient at exchanging
materials within themselves and with their environment, but they are still functional. These
cells typically have more than one copy of their genetic information, so they can manufacture
proteins locally within diﬀerent parts of the cell.
Key concepts: Cell size:
• Is limited by need for regions of cell to communicate
• Diﬀuse oxygen and other gases
21 22
• Transport of mRNA and protein s
• Surface area to volume ratio limited
• Larger cells typically:
• Have extra copies of genetic information
• Have slower communication between parts of cell

308 Structure of Eukaryotic cells
1
Eukaryotic cells feature membrane delimited nucleii containing two or more linear chromo-
2 3 4
some s; numerous membrane-bound cytoplasmic organelles: mitochondria, RER , SER ,
5 6 7
lysosomes, vacuole s, chloroplast s; ribosomes and a cytoskeleton . Also, plants, fungi, and
some protists have a cell wall.
8.1 Structure of the nucleus
The nucleus is the round object in the cell that holds the genetic information (DNA) of the
cell. It is surrounded by a nuclear envelope and has a nucleolus inside.
8.1.1 Nuclear envelope
8
The nuclear envelope is a double-layered plasma membrane like the cell membrane, although
without membrane proteins. To allow some chemicals to enter the nucleus, the nuclear
9
envelope has structures called Nuclear pore s. The nuclear envelope is continuous with the
endoplasmic reticulum.
8.1.2 Nucleolus
The nucleolus appears in a microscope as a small dark area within the nucleus. The nucleolus
10
is the area where there is a high amount of DNA transcription taking place.

11
Chromosomes consist of chromatin . This is made up of strings of DNA, which typically
12
measure centimeters in length if stretched out. This DNA is wound around a histone core
13
and organized into nucleosome s.
14 15 16
The chromatin must be uncoiled for gene expression and replication . Chromosome

8.3 Endoplasmic reticulum
17 18
The endoplasmic reticulum is a cellular organelle made up of a series of extended folded
intracellular membranes. It is continuous with the nuclear membane.
There are two main types of endoplasmic reticulum:
19
• RER: rough endoplasmic reticulum (site of protein synthesis ) associated with ribosomes
20
• SER: smooth endoplasmic reticulum (site of lipid synthesis )
8.3.1 Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum
21
Proteins are directed to the RER by a signal sequence of a growing polypeptide s on
the ribosome. This is recognised by a signal recognition particle which brings the ribo-
some/polypeptide complex to a channel on the RER called a translocon. At the translocon,
the signal sequence and ribosome/polypeptide complex interact with the translocon to open
it. The signal sequence becomes attached to the translocon. The ribosome can continue to
translate the polypeptide into the lumen of the RER. As synthesis continues, 2 processes
can happen.
1. If the protein is destined to become a membrane bound protein then the protein
synthesis will continue until termination. The ribosome can then dissociate, allowing
protein folding within the RER lumen to occur and continuation to the golgi apparatus
for processing of the polypeptide.
2. Iftheproteinisdestinedforstorageforlatersecretionafterstimulationorforcontinuous
secretion then a protease-enzyme which cuts proteins at the peptide bond-can cut the
signal sequence from the growing polypeptide. Continuation to the golgi etc. can then
occur.

32Endoplasmic reticulum
When produced, proteins are then exported to one of several locations. The proteins are
either modiﬁed for extracellular membrane insertion or secretion. Note, this is in contrast
with ribosomes which do not associate with the RER and produce proteins which will become
cytosolic enzymes for example.
8.3.2 Smooth Endoplasmic Reticulum
22
Smooth endoplasmic reticulum produces enzyme s for lipid and carbohydrate biosynthesis
and detoxiﬁcation RER
8.3.3 Sarcoplasmic Reticulum
This is a specialised form of endoplasmic reticulum found in some muscle cell types-
particularly striated, skeletal muscle. Its main function is diﬀerent from the other 2 types in
that is mainly acts as a storage of calcium. This reticulum has voltage gated channels which
respond to signals from 'motor neurones' to open and release calcium into the cytoplasm.
This can then bring about the next part in muscle contraction.

8.4 The Golgi apparatus
24
The golgi apparatus is made up of multiple stacks of bilipid membranes.
• Proteins made on the RER are modiﬁed and then sorted
• Formation of secretory vesicles
• Formation of lysosomes (intracellular digestion)
Other membrane-bound cytoplasmic organelles include:
25
• Microbodies (generic term)
• Glyoxysome (transforms fat into carbohydrate in plants)
26
• Peroxisome (uses oxidative metabolism to form hydrogen peroxide and is destroyed by
27
catalase )
8.5 Ribosomes
Ribosomes are the site of protein synthesis. Ribosomes themselves are synthesized in the
28
cell nucleoli and are structured as two subunits, the large and the small. These parts are
composed of RNA and protein.
Prokaryotic and eukaryotic ribosomes are diﬀerent, the eukaryotic ones being larger and
more complicated.

• Consist of 9 triplet microtubules
31 32
• Mitosis , meiosis
8.7 Cytoskeleton
Cytoskeleton is a collective term for diﬀerent ﬁlaments of proteins that can give physical
shape within the cell and are responsible for the 'roads' which organelles can be carried
along.
• Gives the cell shape
• Anchors other organelles
• Vital to intracellular transport of large molecules
The cytoskeleton is composed of 3 main types of ﬁlaments:
33
• Actin ﬁlaments (7 nm)
34
• Microtubule s: (25 nm) polymer of tubulin; 13/ring.
35
• Intermediate Filament s
Both actin and microtubules can have associated motor proteins.
8.7.1 Intermediate Filaments
These are rope like ﬁlaments, 8-10nm in diameter and tend to give the structural stability to
cells. Examples inculude Vimentin, neuroﬁlaments and keratin. It is keratin which priniciply
makes up hair, nails and horns.
8.7.2 Actin Filaments
Growth
These ﬁlaments are 2-stranded and composed of dimeric subunits called G-Actin. They
contain a GTP molecule in order to bind (polymerise). As GTP is hydrolysed then the
structure becomes unstable and depolymerisation occurs. The growth of actin ﬁlaments is
concentration dependant-that is, the higher the concentration of free G-actin, the greater
the polymerisation. The are also polar, having a + and a - end (not related to charge) and
polymerisation tends to happen faster at the + end.

4913 Photosynthesis
6 CO + 6 H O→ C H O + 6 O
2 2 6 12 6 2
• One of most important reactions in history of life:
• source of atmospheric O
2
• ultimately led to aerobic respiration and eukaryotes
• Responsible for bulk of glucose production
• Early experiments showed that mass of plant must be derived from substances in the air,
not the soil
• Experiments with isotopes showed that liberated oxygen comes from water
• Experiments also showed that light is essential but that some reactions (e.g., reduction of
CO ) continue in the dark
2
• Plants do two big, important things during photosynthesis: gain energy (absorb light)
and build sugar (glucose).
• Photosynthesis can be divided into two series of chemical reactions: the light (light-
dependent) reactions and the dark (light-independent) reactions. In light reactions, light
is absorbed; in dark reactions, sugar is built.
• Occurs when plants, algae, and autotrophic bacteria absorb light energy and build glucose.
13.1 Light Reactions
• Part of the electromagnetic spectrum
• Consists of units of energy called photons
• Photons at UV end of spectrum have more energy than those at the red end
• Occur on the surface of thylakoid disks
• Chlorophyll and other plant pigments diﬀerentially absorb photons
• Chlorophyll a: light to chemical energy
• Chlorophyll b: accessory chlorophyll
• Chlorophylls absorb primarily blue and red (green reﬂected back, hence the green
color of plants)
13.1.1 Accessory pigments
• Chlorophyll is a major light gathering pigment
• Absorbs light with considerable eﬃciency (i.e., retaining energy)
• Accessory pigments
• Chlorophyll b
• Carotenoinds
• capture light of wavelengths not captured by chlorophylls
51Photosynthesis
• Confer other colors to plant leaves (autumn colors too)
Photosynthetic steps
• Primary photoevent: light photon captured by photosystem and energy transferred to
electron donated by water
• Electron transport: excited electron is shuttled along imbedded series of electron carriers
to proton pump and electron is transferred to acceptor
• Chemiosmosis: transport of protons back into chloroplast drives synthesis of ATP
13.1.2 The Even More Detailed Light Reactions
What the Light Reactions Do:
The light reactions of photosynthesis occur in chloroplasts in and on the thylakoid disks.
During the light reactions, light energy charges up ATP molecules. More speciﬁcally, light
turns the chloroplast into an acid battery, and this battery charges up ATP.
How the "Chloroplast-Battery" Charges ATP:
The stroma is the ﬂuid inside of the chloroplasts, and it carries a negative charge. This
means that it contains about a "gazillion" extra electrons. The solvent of stroma is water.
The ﬂuid inside the thylakoid disks is positively charged because it contains a lot of hydrogen
(H+) ions. The pH here is low, making the ﬂuid very acidic. The solvent of thylakoid disk
ﬂuid is water.
A chloroplast acts like a battery, because it has separated a strong positive charge and a
strong negative charge in two diﬀerent compartments. Energy is released when H+ ions
(free protons) ﬂow from the inside of a thylakoid disk to the stroma. This is electrical energy,
since it is a ﬂow of charged particles.
The protons pass through special channels (made of protein) in the thylakoid membrane;
this reaction is 'exothermic.' The energy that is given oﬀ is used to fuel this reaction (Pi is
the phosphate ion):
ADP + Pi --> ATP
The proton can go to the negative stroma, but only if it uses its energy to charge up ATP.
Since one reaction wants to go, and the other one doesn't, and since the ﬁrst reaction releases
energy and the second one absorbs energy, the two reactions are known to be 'coupled'
together so that the ﬁrst fuels the second. Of course, a special enzyme must be involved for
this to happen.
Chlorophyll Molecules on a Thylakoid Disk:
Hundreds of chlorophyll molecules cover the surface of a thylakoid disk, making the disk
green. The nonpolar "tails" of the chlorophyll molecule are embedded in the membrane of
the thylakoid.
52“Dark” reactions
13.2 “Dark” reactions
• ATP drives endergonic reactions
• NADPH provides hydrogens for reduction of CO to carbohydrate (C-H bonds)
2
• Occur in the stroma
• First step in carbon ﬁxation
13.2.1 The Detailed Dark Reactions
What the Dark Reactions Do:
The dark reactions build sugar from carbon dioxide gas (CO2), water (H2O), and energy
from ATP molecules that were charged up during the light reactions. The dark reactions
occur in the stroma of a chloroplast. Dark reactions usually occur in the light, but they
don't have to. They'll occur in the dark until the chloroplast's supply of ATP runs out
(usually about 30 seconds).
The Calvin Cycle:
The Calvin Cycle is the fancy name for the metabolic pathway that builds sugar. This
means that it involves a whole lot of chemical reactions, and it uses a lot of diﬀerent enzymes
to catalyze the reactions.
Carbon dioxide gas is stable, therefore the bonds that hold the carbon and oxygen atoms
are strong. Therefore it takes a lot of energy to break the bonds and separate the carbon
atoms from the oxygen atoms. The energy needed to do this comes from ATP molecules.
When inorganic carbon (like from CO2) is being added to an organic molecule (such as
sugar), this is called carbon ﬁxation.
It takes 2 complete turns of the Calvin Cycle to make a glucose molecule.

state of replication)
• Model organism of bacterial cell division
53Photosynthesis
13.4 Bacterial DNA replication
• Replication follows rules of base pairing, with each polynucleotide chain serving as
template for synthesis of its complement.
• Genetic evidence showed that the bacterial chromosome is circular long before there was
corroborating physical evidence.
Eukaryotic chromosomes
• Discovered by Walther Fleming in 1882 in dividing cells of salamander larvae, following
improvements in microscopes and staining technology
• He called division mitosis (mitos = “thread”)
• Chromosome number is constant in a species
• Ranges from 2 to >500 (46 in human somatic cells)
• Homologous pairs, one contributed by each parent
• Change in number is cause and consequence of speciation
• Chromosome constancy and their precise division in mitosis and meiosis led biologists to
postulate that they were carriers of hereditary information
13.5 Chromosome number
• 1N = number of chromosomes in gamete
• 1N = haploid chromosome number
• 2N = number of chromosomes in somatic cells (cells that are not egg or sperm)
• 2N = diploid
• Deviations from N or 2N are usually lethal in animals
Chromosome numbers
13.6 Eukaryotic chromosomes

• C: cytoplasmic division
13.11 Mitotic cell cycle
• Cells exiting the cell cycle are said to be in G0
• Cell cycle time varies with stages of life cycle and development, with G1 the most variable
• DNA replication occurs during S phase of the cell cycle following G1.
- at this point the chromosomes are composed of two sister
chromotids connected by a common centromere.

• Cyclin: short-lived proteins that bind to cdks
13.15 Controlling the cell cycle
• External signals initiate cell division in multicellular organisms
• Growth factors: extracellular regulatory signals
• Usually soluble; bind to cell surface receptor

6115 Genetics
6316 Gregor Mendel and biological
inheritance
1
Charles Darwin , for all he contributed to the science of biology, never knew about the
mechanism by which living things inherit traits from previous generations, or how new traits
arise.
As any schoolchild can tell you, this mechanism of interitance has since been found to be
2
DNA , or deoxyribonucleic acid. DNA allows for stable inheritance of traits: the code in
each strand of DNA is replicated precisely through the pairing of basic units along each
strand. The error rate in this replication is amazingly low; not even one base pair in a
million matches out of sequence.
However, when even one base pair is added to a new strain of DNA in an order diﬀerently
than in the parent chain, it can be the basis of amutation. These changes in DNA sequences
are the microscopic origin of changes in traits of all studied living things. Even the smallest
diﬀerence in a strand of DNA can result in a change in traits that can cost the life of the
organism. Mutations can produce proteins with a new or altered function. In humans, the
3
example of Sickle cell anemia is commonly given as its origin is a diﬀerence of only one
base pair in a section of DNA that encodes red blood cells.
Individual sequences of DNA that encode for speciﬁc proteins are called genes and are the
4
units of heredity. Each one has a set nucleotide , and together all of the genes (and some
sequence of DNA that apparently do not code for any biologically important functions)
5
together make up the entire chromosome
16.1 Mendel
• Discovered principle of genetic segregation via numerous experiments utilizing pea plants
• Inferred the existence of genes through segregation of phenotypes
• Used quantitative methods: counted; ratios
• Work is model of scientiﬁc method
• In particular, observed the F2 progeny, which lead to the discovery of dominant and
recessive traits
• Published work in 1866, went unnoticed
• In 1900 his scientiﬁc paper was “rediscovered”

5 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chromosome
65Gregor Mendel and biological inheritance
• Mendel is acknowledged as founder of Genetics
• still used alphabet letters to designate genes
• still refer to dominant and recessive genes
• still refer to segregation of alleles in meiosis
• principle of segregation applies to all sexually reproducing organisms; Mendel’s results
were immediately applied to humans in 1900
16.2 Mendel’s experiments
• 1856, began experiments with the garden pea, Pisum sativum
• 1865, presented results to the Bruno natural history society, which he helped found
• 1866, published his results in proceedings of the society
• Naegeli encouraged Mendel to reproduce results in another species, which failed because
the species did not undergo true fertilization
• discrete traits in Pisum sativum
• pure-breeding lines
• dominant/recessive alleles
• alleles are two alternate versions of a gene
• gametes contain hybridized chromosomes that are formed during meiosis
• homozygous has two of the same allele
• heterozygous has two diﬀerent alleles
• reciprocal F1 crosses (all exhibiting dominant phenotypes); F2; F3
• counted oﬀspring, noted ratios
• inferred genotypes from phenotypes
• tested hypotheses with testcrosses
• attempted to repeat with another species
16.3 Mendel’s seven pairs of traits
1. Seed form (round or wrinkled)
2. Cotyledon color (green or yellow)
3. Seed coat color (white or colored)
4. Pod form (inﬂated or constricted)
5. Pod color (green or yellow)
6. Flower position (axial or terminal)
7. Plant heights (tall or short)
16.4 Locus
• The location of a speciﬁc gene within a chromosome
66Modern Y chromosome
16.5 Modern Y chromosome
Y-chromosome is the most evolved chromosome. Generally it is thought that if Y- chro-
mosome is present in an individual then he will be male. But if mutation occurs at sex
determining region or zinc factor then it will not code for testis determining factor, and
results in normal female. This type of female's frequency is 1/250000.
16.6 Chromosome phenomena
• X-chromosome inactivation
• Barr bodies
• Nondisjunction: failure of chromosome segregation at meiosis or mitosis
• Results in 2N± 1 chromosome number
• Trisomy 2N + 1
• Usually lethal. Trisomy 21 (Down) exception
• Monosomy 2N ** 1
• Lethal except XO
• Usually maternal origin in humans
16.7 X-chromosome inactivation
In females, one X-chromosone is randomly switched oﬀ forming a Barr body.
16.8 Barr body
Dense region in the nucleus formed by the inactive X-chromosome.
16.9 Human genetic disorders
Down's Syndrome(Mongolism)
Down's Syndrome is usually produced by the nondisjunction of chromosome 21 during
oogenesis and sometimes during spermatogenesis. The individual suﬀering from this type of
syndrome has 47 chromosomes instead of the normal 46. The extra chromosome is not a sex
chromosome but an autosome.
Most cases of mongolism were found to occur in children born by women in their forties.
The aﬀected children, called mongoloids, show mental retardation and have a shorter life
expectancy. Their most prominent feature is the Mongolian folds in their eyes; hence, the
term mongolism.
Klinefelter's Syndrome
67Gregor Mendel and biological inheritance
When an XY-bearing sperm unites with an X-bearing egg, the resulting condition is called
Klinefelter's Syndrome, or sexually undeveloped male. Individuals having the syndrome
show the following characteristics:
• testes are small
• sperms are never produced
• breasts are enlarged
• body hair is sparse
• individuals are mentally defective
The same abnormal meiotic division may occur in females. They produce eggs with XX or
no sex chromosomes. Such egg, when fertilized by a Y-bearing sperm, will not develop (YO).
This is because YO is lethal--it wil cause death to the oﬀspring.
6817 DNA: The Genetic Material
17.1 DNA
DNA stands for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid. That is, a nucleic acid with two sugars. DNA is
the hereditary material of cells and is considered the blueprint of life. DNA is found in all
kingdoms of life. Even most viruses have DNA. A molecule of DNA is chemically stable (it
does not have a 2-prime alcohol group.)
When someone says DNA, they may be referring to one's genetic material on multiple levels:
They may be speaking about a single deoxyribose nucleic acid molecule, a section of a double
helix, a section of a chromosome, or one's entire hereditary composition.
• antiparallel
• Double helix
• Semiconservative replication
• Sequence of nucleotides encodes functional RNA or polypeptide
17.2 Historical perspective
• Mitosis and meiosis
• Regular distribution of chromosomes suggested that they contain hereditary informa-
tion
• Bridges/Morgan, usingDrosophilamelanogastershowedthatgenesareonchromosomes
(1910s)
• Hammerling: nucleus contains hereditary information (1930s)
• Griﬃth: transformation of bacteria (1928)
• Avery, MacLeod, McCarty: transforming substance is DNA (1944)
• Hershey, Chase: DNA is hereditary material of viruses (1952)
• Rosalind Franklin
• Watson and Crick: structure of DNA (1953)
17.3 Hershey-Chase Experiment
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading suggestions that DNA was a
genetic material. Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA
into a bacterium. They did two experiments marking either the DNA in the phage with
a radioactive phophorus or the protein of the phage with radioactive sulfur. With the
bacteria that was infected by the phages with radioactive DNA the DNA in the bacteria
69DNA: The Genetic Material
was radioactive. In the bacteria that was infected with the radioactive protein the bacteria
was radioactive, not the DNA. This proves that DNA is a genetic material and it is passed
on in viruses.
17.4 DNA/RNA components
• Miescher: discovered DNA, 1869
17.4.1 Structure of DNA
DNA is in a double helix structure made up of nucleotides. The "backbone" of the double
helix is composed of phosphates connected to a ﬁve carbon sugar called deoxyribose, . The
"rungs" are composed of nitrogenous bases, Purines and Pyrimidines. Purines contain
Adenine(A) and Guanine(G) and have two rings in their structures. Pyrimidines contain
Cytosine(C) and Thymine (T) and have one ring in their structures.

8020 Mutation
1
A mutation is a permanent change to an organism's genetic material (DNA or RNA).
Mutations are a rare but signiﬁcant biological process, since they provide the variation on
2
which evolution acts and are also the source of cancer.
3
An organism's genetic material is made up of polymers (chains) of four diﬀerent nucleotides ,
like a recipe book written in a language of only four letters. A mutation event is when the
order of the nucleotides in DNA change, usually when the DNA is being copied.
Mutations come in a number of forms:
20.1 Point Mutations
Point mutations are all mutations which involve a single nucleotide. These come in the form
of substitutions, insertions and deletions:
20.2 Substitution
Substitution Mutations: In substitution mutations, a nitrogenous base of a triplet codon of
DNA is replaced by another nitrogen base or some derivative of the nitrogen base, changing
the codon. The altered codon codes for a diﬀerent amino acid substitution.The substitution
mutations are of two types:
1.Transitions: It is the replacement of one purine in a polynucleotide chain by another
purine(A by G or C by A) or one pyrimidine by another pyrimidine(T by C or C by T)
2.Transversions:A base pair substitution involving the substitution of a purine by pyrimidine
or pyrimidine by a purine is called transversion.

20.4.4 Segmental Duplication
20.4.5 Chromosomal Duplication
20.4.6 Genome Duplication
20.5 Causes of mutations
20.6 Eﬀects of mutations
Mutations can have a variety of diﬀerent eﬀects depending on the type of mutation, the
signiﬁcance of the piece of genetic material aﬀected and whether the cells aﬀected are germ-
82Further reading
line cells. Only mutations in germ-line cells can be passed on to children, while mutations
elsewhere can cause cell-death or cancer.
Mutations can be classiﬁed by their eﬀects:
20.6.1 Silent Mutation
Silent Mutations are DNA mutations that do not result in a change to the amino acid
sequence or a protein. They may occur in a non-coding region (outside of a gene or within
an intron), or they may occur within an exon in a manner that does not alter the ﬁnal
amino acid chain.
20.6.2 Frameshift
20.6.3 Missense Mutation
Missense mutations are types of point mutations where a single nucleotide is changed to
cause substitution of a diﬀerent amino acid. This in turn can render the resulting protein
nonfunctional. Such mutations are responsible for diseases such as Epidermolysis bullosa.

9122 Classiﬁcation of Living Things
22.0.1 Classiﬁcation of Living Things & Naming
With so many ﬂora and fauna on planet Earth, there must be a method to classify each
organism to distinguish it from others so it can be correctly identiﬁed. Classiﬁcation does
not only apply to biology. For example, supermarkets and grocery stores organise their
products by classifying them. Beverages may occupy one aisle, while cleaning supplies may
occupy another. In science, the practice of classifying organisms is called taxonomy (Taxis
means arrangement and nomos means law). The modern taxonomic system was developed
by the Swedish botanist Carolus (Carl) Linneaeus (1707-1788). He used simple physical
characteristics of organisms to identify and diﬀerentiate between diﬀerent species.
Linneaeus developed a hierarchy of groups for taxonomy. To distinguish diﬀerent levels of
similarity, each classifying group, called taxon (pl. taxa) is subdivided into other groups.
To remember the order, it is helpful to use a mnemonic device. The taxa in hierarchical
order:
• Domain - Archea, Eubacteria, Eukaryote
• Kingdom - Plants, Animals, Fungi, Protists, Eubacteria (Monera), Archaebacteria
• Phylum
• Class
• Order
• Family
• Genus
• Species
The domain is the broadest category, while species is the most speciﬁc category available.
The taxon Domain was only introduced in 1990 by Carl Woese, as scientists reorganise
things based on new discoveries and information. For example, the European Hare would
be classiﬁed as follows:
Eukaryote --> Animal --> Chordata --> Mammalia --> Lagomorpha --> Leporidae -->
Lepus --> Lepus europaeus.
Binomial nomenclature is used to name an organism, where the ﬁrst word beginning
with a capital is the genus of the organism and the second word beginning with lower-case
letter is the species of the organism. The name must be in italics and in Latin, which was
the major language of arts and sciences in the 18th century. The scientiﬁc name can be also
abbreviated, where the genus is shortened to only its ﬁrst letter followed by a period. In our
example, Lepus europaeus would become L. europaeus'.
Taxonomy and binomial nomenclature are both speciﬁc methods of classifying an organism.
They help to eliminate problems, such as mistaken identity and false assumptions, caused
by common names. An example of the former is the fact that a North American robin is
93Classiﬁcation of Living Things
quite diﬀerent from the English robin. An example of the latter is the comparison between
crayﬁsh and catﬁsh, where one might believe that they both are ﬁsh when in fact, they are
quite diﬀerent.
Nomenclature is concerned with the assignment of names to taxonomic groups in agreement
with published rules.
22.0.2 Eukaryotes & Prokaryotes
Recall that there are two basic types of cells: eukaryotes and prokaryotes.
Eukaryotes are more complex in structure, with nuclei and membrane-bound organelles.
Some characteristics of eukaryotes are:
• Large (100 - 1000 μm)
• DNA in nucleus, bounded by membrane
• Genome consists of several chromosomes.
• Sexual reproduction common, by mitosis and meiosis
• Mitochondria and other organelles present
• Most forms are multicellular
• Aerobic
Prokaryotes refer to the smallest and simplest type of cells, without a true nucleus and no
membrane-bound organelles. Bacteria fall under this category. Some characteristics:
• Small (1-10 μm)
• DNA circular, unbounded
• Genome consists of single chromosome.
• Asexual reproduction common, not by mitosis or meiosis.
• No general organelles
• Most forms are singular
• Anaerobic
22.0.3 The Three Domains
The three domains are organised based on the diﬀerence between eukaryotes and prokaryotes.
Today's living prokaryotes are extremely diverse and diﬀerent from eukaryotes. This fact has
been proven by molecular biological studies (e.g. of RNA structure) with modern technology.
The three domains are as follows:
Archea (Archeabacteria) consists of archeabacteria, bacteria which live in extreme
environments. The kingdom Archaea belongs to this domain.
Eubacteriaconsistsofmoretypicalbacteriafoundineverydaylife. ThekingdomEubacteria
belongs to this domain.
Eukaryote encompasses most of the world's visible living things. The kingdoms Protista,
Fungi, Plantae, and Animalia fall under this category.
94Stem cells
22.0.4 The Six Kingdoms
Under the three domains are six kingdoms in taxonomy. The ﬁrst two, Plants andAnimals,
are commonly understood and will not be expounded here.
Protista, the third kingdom, was introduced by the German biologist Ernst Haeckel in
1866 to classify micro-organisms which are neither animals nor plants. Since protists are
quite irregular, this kingdom is the least understood and the genetic similarities between
organisms in this kingdom are largely unknown. For example, some protists can exhibit
properties of both animals and plants.
Fungi are organisms which obtain food by absorbing materials in their bodies. Mushrooms
and moulds belong in this kingdom. Originally, they were part of the plant kingdom but
were recategorised when they were discovered not to photosynthesise.
Eubacteria are bacteria, made up of small cells, which diﬀer in appearance from the
organisms in the above kingdoms. They lack a nucleus and cell organelles. They have cell
walls made of peptidoglycan.
Archae (or Archaebacteria) are bacteria which live in extreme environments, such as
salt lakes or hot, acidic springs. These bacteria are in their own category as detailed studies
have shown that they have unique properties and features (ex. unusual lipids that are not
found in any other organism)which diﬀer them from other bacteria and which allow them to
live where they live. Their cell walls lack peptidoglycan.
22.0.5 Origins of Diversity
The diversity in our planet is attributed to diversity within a species. As the world changed
in climate and in geography as time passed, the characteristics of species diverged so much
that new species were formed. This process, by which new species evolve, was ﬁrst described
by British naturalist Charles Darwin as natural selection.
For an organism to change, genetic mutations must occur. At times, genetic mutations are
accidental, as in the case of prokaryotes when they undergo asexual reproduction. For most
eukaryotes, genetic mutations occur through sexual reproduction, where meiosis produces
haploid gametes from the original parent cells. The fusion of these haploid gametes into
a diploid zygote results in genetic variation in each generation. Over time, with enough
arrangement of genes and traits, new species are produced. Sexual reproduction creates an
immense potential of genetic variety.
One goal of taxonomy is to determine the evolutionary history of organisms. This can be
achieved by comparing species living today with species in the past. The comparison in
anatomy and structure is based on data from development, physical anatomy, biochemistry,
DNA, behaviour, and ecological preferences. The following are examples of how such data is
used:
• Anatomy:
Although a horse and a human may look diﬀerent, there is evidence that their arm structures
are quite similar. Their arms' sizes and proportions may be diﬀerent, but the anatomical
structures are quite similar. Such evidence reveals that animals in diﬀerent taxa may not
95Classiﬁcation of Living Things
be that diﬀerent. Biological features from a common evolutionary origin are known as
homologous.
• Development
• Biochemistry:
Biochemical analysis of animals similar in appearance have yielded surprising results. For
example, although guinea pigs were once considered to be rodents, like mice, biochemistry
led them to be in their taxon of their own.
22.0.6 Phylogeny, Cladistics & Cladogram
Modern taxonomy is based on many hypotheses' of the evolutionary history of organisms,
known as phylogeny. As with the Scientiﬁc Method, scientists develop a hypothesis on the
history of an animal and utilise modern science and technology to prove the phylogeny.
Cladistics is a classiﬁcation system which is based on phylogeny. Expanding on phylogeny,
cladistics is based on the assumption that each group of related species has one common
ancestor and would therefore retain some ancestral characteristics. Moreover, as these
related species evolve and diverge from their common ancestor, they would develop unique
characteristics. Such characteristics are known as derived characteristics
The principles of phylogeny and cladistics can be expressed visually as a cladogram,
a branching diagram which acts as a family (phylogenetic) tree for similar species. A
cladogram can also be used to test alternative hypotheses for an animal's phylogeny. In
order to determine the most likely cladogram, the derived characteristics of similar species
are matched and analysed.

22.1 Introduction
Viruses are the smallest biological particle (the tiniest are only 20 nm in diameter). However,
they are not biological organisms so they are not classiﬁed in any kingdom of living things.
They do not have any organelles and cannot respire or perform metabolic functions. Viruses
are merely strands of DNA or RNA surrounded by a protective protein coat called a capsid.
Viruses only come to life when they have invaded a cell. Outside of a host cell, viruses are
completely inert.
Since ﬁrst being identiﬁed in 1935, viruses have been classiﬁed into more than 160 major
groups. Viruses are classiﬁed based on their shape, replication properties, and the diseases
that they cause. Furthermore, the shape of a virus is determined by the type and arrangement
of proteins in its capsid. Viruses pathogenic to humans are currently classiﬁed into 21 groups.
Viruses can also attack bacteria and infect bacterial cells. Such viruses are called bacterio-
phages.
97Classiﬁcation of Living Things
22.2 Viral Replication
As previously stated, viruses are not a biological life form so they cannot reproduce by
themselves. They need to take over a functioning eukaryotic or prokaryotic cell to replicate
its DNA or RNA and to make protein coat for new virus particles.
In order to enter a cell, a virus must attach to a speciﬁc receptor site on the plasma membrane
of the host cell. The proteins on the surface of the virus act as keys which ﬁt exactly into a
matching glycoprotein on the host cell membrane. In some viruses, the attachment protein
is not on the surface of the virus but is in the capsid or in the envelope.
There are two forms of viral replication: the lytic cycle and the lysogenic cycle.
22.2.1 Lytic Cycle
1. Attachment: The virus binds to speciﬁc receptors on the host cell.
2. Entry: There are two ways in which a virus can enter cells. Firstly, the virus can inject
its nucleic acid into the host cell. Secondly, if a virus is contained in an envelope, the
host cell can phagocytosise the entire virus particle into a vacuole. When the virus
breaks out of the vacuole, it then releases its nucleic acid into the cell.
3. Replication: The virus's nucleic acid instructs the host cell to replicate the virus's
DNA or RNA.
4. Assembly: New virus particles are assembled.
5. Lysis and Release: The virus directs the production of an enzyme which damages
the host cell wall, causing the host cell to swell and burst. The newly formed virus
particles are now released.
22.2.2 Lysogenic Cycle
1. Attachment: Similar to Lytic Cycle
2. Entry: Similar to Lytic Cycle
3. Incorporation: The viral nucleic acids is not replicated, but instead integrated by
genetic combination (crossing over) into the host cell's chromosome. When integrated
in a host cell this way, the viral nucleic acid as part of the host cell's chromosome is
known as a prophage.
4. Host Cell Reproduction: The host cell reproduces normally. Subsequent cell divisions,
daughter cells, contain original father cell's chromosome embedded with a prophage.
5. Cycle Induction: Certain factors now determine whether the daughter cell undergoes
the lytic or lysogenic cycle. At any time, a cell undergoing the lysogenic cycle can
switch to the lytic cycle.
The reproduction cycle of viruses with RNA and no DNA is slightly diﬀerent. A notable
example of a RNA-based virus is HIV, a retrovirus.
98Viral Genome
Retrovirus reproductive cycle
1. The retrovirus force RNA into cell, by either one of the two methods of entry (See
above).
2. In the retrovirus are reverse transcriptase enzymes, which catalyses the synthesis of a
DNA strand complementary to the viral RNA.
3. Reverse transcriptase catalyses a second DNA strand complementary to the ﬁrst. With
these two strands, the double-stranded DNA can be created.
4. DNA is then incorporated into the host cell's chromosomes. Similar to the concept of
a prophage, this incorporated DNA is called a provirus. However, the provirus never
leaves the host cell, unlike a prophage.
5. The infected host cell undergoes the lytic or lysogenic cycle.
22.3 Viral Genome
The genome of a virus consists of DNA or RNA, whose size and conﬁguration vary. The
entire genome can exist as a single nucleic acid molecule or several nucleic acid segments.
Also, the DNA or RNA may be single-stranded or double-stranded, and either linear or
circular.
Not all viruses can reproduce in a host cell by themselves. Since viruses are so small, the
size of their genome is limiting. For example, some viruses have coded instructions for only
making a few diﬀerent proteins for the viruses' capsid. On the other hand, the human
genome codes for over 30,000 diﬀerent proteins. Therefore, the lack of coded instructions
cause some viruses to need the presence of other viruses to help them reproduce themselves.
Such viruses are called replication defective.
Lastly, it is worthy to note that 70% of all viruses are RNA viruses. As the process of RNA
replication (with enzymes and other organelles of the host cell) is more prone to errors, RNA
viruses have much higher mutation rates than do DNA viruses.
22.4 Viruses Practice Questions

possible for this virus to target other fruits as well? Explain.
2. If a DNA and a RNA virus both infected somatic cells, which virus would be more
diﬃcult to detect?
3. Many people have had cold sores, which are caused by infection with the herpes
simplex virus. One characteristic of cold sores is that after a period of inactivity, they
will reappear many times during the course of a person's life. Which cycle would the
herpes simplex virus undergo?
4. Chicken pox is a common, non-fatal disease usually acquired in adolescence and caused
by the varicella zoster virus. In adulthood, many people suﬀer from shingles, an altered
form of the varicella zoster virus. Which cycle would the varicella zoster virus have
undergone?
5. Would an antibiotic work for a person suﬀering from a cold of ﬂu? Explain.

100Domains of life: characteristics
22.7 Domains of life: characteristics
This text is based on notes very generously donated by Paul Doerder, Ph.D., of the Cleveland
State University.
22.8 Introduction
Out of the six kingdoms, Protista is the most diverse. This is the kingdom of organisms
with strange, atypical characteristics. In essence, this kingdom is designated for organisms
which do not belong in any other kingdom. The majority of protists are microscopic.
22.9 Classiﬁcation of Protists
There are three phyla of protists, based on their type of nutrition.
1. Protozoa (animal-like protists) are heterotrophs that ingest or absorb their food.
2. Algae (plant-like protists) are autotrophs they get nutrition from photosythesis.
3. Slime moulds and water moulds (fungus-like protists) are also heterotrophs, like
protozoa.
22.10 Protozoa
As heterotrophs, protozoa scavenge materials from their surroundings. Others are predators
which actively hunt or ambush small organisms such as bacteria and other protozoa for a
source of nutrition. Protozoa can be parasitic as well; they may live inside larger organisms,
like humans. Most protozoa live as single cells, although a few form colonies.
Protozoa are generally diﬃcult to identify due to their varied shape. They may appear as
jelly-like blobs, spherical sunbursts, or a ﬂattened leaf. Tiny blood parasites may be only 2
μm long. On the other hand, shell-covered marine may be 5 cm or more in diameter.
Furthermore, diﬀerent protozoans have their own complex life cycles. The complexity has
led certain organisms to be mistakenly classiﬁed for other species.
Nevertheless, protozoa can move, and so, they are classiﬁed based on their methods of
locomotion.
Characteristics of Protozoa :
• About 30,000 species known
• About 10,000 species are pathogenic, including some of the worst human diseases
• heterotrophic
• highly variable in form and life cycle
101Classiﬁcation of Living Things
• mostly unicellular
• range in size from 0.005 mm to 50 mm
• lack cell walls
they love environment and each other..............
22.11 Algae
Algae are much simpler than protozoa. They are aquatic and contain chlorophyll. Algae can
exist as a single cell or as giant seaweeds 60 m in length. Formerly, algae were classiﬁed as
plants but this was incorrect as algae lack parts of true plants: leaves, stems, roots, xylem,
and phloem. Since algae belong in the kingdom Protista, algae is a broad term used to
denote all aquatic eukaryotes which photosynthesise; algae can diﬀer in size and shape as
well.
There are six phyla of algae:chlorophytes (green algae), phaeophytes (brown algae),
rhodophytes (red algae), chrysophytes (diatoms), pyrrophytes (dinoﬂagellates),
and euglenophytes (euglenoids).
22.11.1 Chlorophytes
Chlorophytes resemble plants the most. Like plants, their cell walls contain cellulose and
they store food in reserve as starch. Chlorophytes can be unicellular or multicellular. Most
chlorophytes use ﬂagellae for some locomotion.
22.11.2 Phaeophytes
Phaeophytes are nearly all multicellular marine organisms, which are known to us as seaweeds.
They have cell walls composed of cellulose and alginic acid (a substance similar to pectin).
The cellulose and alignic acid help to retain water and prevent seawood from drying out
when exposed to air at low tide.
Since phaeophytes live in a tidal environment, they have large, ﬂat fronds (a large leaf)
which can withstand pounding by waves. Their bases strongly anchor the algae to the rocky
seabed and prevent them from being washed out to sea. Phaeophytes are usually found in
areas of cold water.
22.11.3 Rhodophytes
Rhodophytes are typically found in warmer seawater, and are more delicate and smaller
than brown algae (phaeophytes). Rhodophytes are also able to grow at deeper depths in
the ocean, since red algae absorb green, violet, and blue light, the wavelengths of which
penetrate the deepest below the water surface. They also have mucilaginous material to
resist drying.
102Slime molds & Water molds
22.11.4 Chryosophytes
Chryosophytes are the most abundant unicellular algae in the oceans. They are also one
of the biggest components of plankton, a free-ﬂoating collection of microorganisms, eggs,
and larvae. As photosynthetic organisms, they produce a signiﬁcant amount of atmospheric
oxygen.
The reproduction cycle of chryosophytes is particularly interesting. Note that diatoms
reproduce both asexually and sexually. Since diatoms have a rigid cell wall with an outer
layer of silica (found in sand and glass), the daughter cells produced by mitosis must ﬁt
inside the original cell wall. Therefore, each generation of diatoms is smaller than the one
before. The reduction in size continues until the diatoms produce sexually, producing a
zygote which eventually grows to the original size as it matures.
22.11.5 Pyrrophytes
Pyrrophytes are unicellular, photosynthetic, and mostly aquatic. They have protective coats
composed of stiﬀ cellulose. They are more easily identiﬁable, due to the presence of two
ﬂagellae. The longer ﬂagellae propels the dinoﬂagellate, while the second shorter, ﬂatter
ﬂagellae functions as a rudder.
Some species of pyrrophytes are zooxanthellae. Since they lack cellulose plates, they make
their home in coral reefs and animals, such as sea anemones, and molluscs. In returning
the favour of sheltering them, dinoﬂagellates provide carbohydrates to their host through
photosynthesis. This is why there are nutrient-rich coral reefs in malnutritions water.
A negative aspect of pyrrophytes is that under certain conditions, species of dinoﬂagellates
reproduce rapidly to form a harmful algal bloom (HAB), known as a red tide if dinoﬂag-
ellates are the cause. Such pyrrophytes can produce toxins which may injure or kill wildlife,
and additionally any consumers of contaminated wildlife.
22.11.6 Euglenophytes
Like pyrrophytes, euglenophytes are small unicellular freshwater organisms with two ﬂagella.
They are mainly autotrophic or heterotrophic, depending if they have a red, light-sensitive
structure called an eyespot.
22.12 Slime molds & Water molds
There are two phyla of slime moulds and one phylum of water moulds.
22.12.1 Oomycotes (Water moulds)
Oomycotes are ﬁlamentous organisms which resemble fungi, in that they live as saprotrophs.
Oomycotes diﬀer from other moulds with the presence of spores and their sexual life cycle.
103Classiﬁcation of Living Things
22.12.2 Myxomycotes (Plasmodial slime moulds)
Myxomycotiesarevisibletothenakedeyeastinyslug-likeorganismswhichcreepoverdecayed
and dead matter. This streaming blob containing many nuclei is called a plasmodium.
22.12.3 Acrasiomycotes (Cellular slime moulds) and its reproductive
cycle
Acrasiomycotes exist as individual amoeboid cells with one nucleus each. When in un-
favourable conditions, each acrasiomycete cell gathers together to form a pseudoplasmod-
ium.
Reproductive Cycle:
1. One acrasiomycete cell joins with others to form a pseudoplasmodium.
2. The pseudoplasmodium shrinks and forms a smaller plasmodium.
3. The plasmodium migrates to a suitable environment.
4. The plasmodium develops a sporangia, where original parental nuclei has divided by
meiosis into haploid spores to be germinated.
5. When favourable conditions arise, the spores germinate and are carried away by animals
or the wind.
6. Cycle repeats.

23.23 Introduction
Although you may not recognise fungi, they are just as prevalent as plants and animals.
Their spores are in the air which we breathe, fungi allow us to make bread, and mushrooms
(a type of fungi) are eaten by us. A few types of fungi are unicellular. For example, yeasts live
as individual oval or cylindrical cells. However, the majority of fungi live are multicellular.
Their bodies are composed of hyphae, a network of ﬁne ﬁlaments. In a mushroom, the
111Multicellular Photosynthetic Autotrophs
hyphae are densely packed so it is diﬃcult to see the individual structures when a mushroom
is eaten. However, a mushroom is only a specialised reproductive part of the whole fungus.
The main part of the fungi is underground in a whole web of hyphae, called a mycelium.
In the mycelium, each fungal cell is separated from each other by a septum. Each fungal
cell may have one or more nuclei and remains connected to the mycelium because the septa
are porous, allowing cytoplasm to ﬂow through the hyphae and fungal cell walls, made of a
hard material called chitin. Some fungi do not have septa, and they appear to be large,
branching, multinucleate cells.
23.24 Nutrition
Fungi are saprophytes. When they ﬁnd a source of food (e.g. dead wood, orange peel) ,
they decompose it and digest it. The enzymes break down larger organic molecules in the
substrate into smaller molecules. These smaller molecules diﬀuse into the fungus, where
they are used to allow growth and repair.
Fungi which feed on living cells are parasitic. For example, athlete's foot grows on the
human foot. These kinds of fungi produce hyphae called haustoria, which can penetrate
host cells without immediately killing them.
However, they are friendlier species of fungi. Many fungi live symbiotically with plants or
animals. For example, most trees have fungi living in close contact with their roots. In this
relationship, known as a mycorrhiza, there are many beneﬁts:
• Growing around the plant roots and often entering plant cells, the hyphae absorb minerals
from the soil and release them in the roots. The fungi gets its source of food (organic
nutrients) while delivering food to the plant.
• The mycelium here would increase the surface area, thus the absorptive surface, of the
plant roots.
• The fungal cells help to maintain air and water ﬂow in the soil around the roots.
• The fungi may prevent other potentially pathogenic fungi to attack the tree.
23.25 Fungal Reproduction
Fungi can reproduce in two ways. Firstly, they make asexually produce through frag-
mentation. This occurs when pieces of hyphae are broken oﬀ, which then grow into new
mycelia.
The second method is by spores. Spores are lightweight structures and windblown designed
to be transported over long distances and by many mediums, such as on the bodies of insects
and birds. They are additionally light enough to be blown away for hundreds of kilometers.
Spores may be asexual and sexual. Their sexual properties can be analysed to classify the
four phylla of fungi.
112Types of Fungi
23.26 Types of Fungi
23.26.1 Zygospore Fungi (Zygomycetes)
This phyllum includes bread moulds and other saprotrophs. Comparable to bacteria, this
phyllum prefers asexual reproduction over sexual reproduction.
1. Two haploid hyphae of opposite types, also known as mating strain + and mating
strain -, combine and fuse together.
2. Plasmogamy, the union of the two parent hyphae, occurs and results in the creation
of a heterokaryotic (n + n) zygosporangium or zygospore. Note that the zygospore is
NOT diploid yet; the haploid nuclei are simply clumped together.
3. Immediately, a thick wall develops around the zygospore to protect it from drying and
other hazards. The zygospore becomes dormant.
4. When conditions are favourable, the zygospore absorbs water and undergoes karyogamy
(n + n = 2n), where the haploid nuclei contributed by the two parents fuse to produce
diploid zygosporangia.
5. The now diploid zygosporangium then undergoes meiosis to form haploid sporangia.
6. Through asexual reproduction of fungi (See above for more information), the spores from
the sporangia germinate and grow into new mycelia.
7. Back to step #1.
23.26.2 Club Fungi (Basidiomycetes)
This phyllum increases mushrooms and shelf fungi. In many ways, the reproduction stages
of this phyllum is similar to that of zygomycetes.
1. Two haploid hyphae of opposite types, also known as mating strain + and mating
strain -, combine and fuse together.
2. Plasmogamy takes place, and a dikaryotic mycelium forms. The dikaryotic mycelium
grows faster then the haploid parental mycelia.
3. Environmental factors cause the dikaryotic mycelium to form compact masses which de-
velop into basidiocarps, short-lived reproductive structures. An example is the mushroom.
4. The basidiocarp gills are lined with terminal dikaryotic cells called basidia, which then
undergo karyogamy.
5. The basidia are now diploid. They undergo meiosis to develop haploid basidiospores, a
term referring to a basidiomycete's spores.
6. Stillremainingonthebasidiocarp, thehaploidbasidiosporeseject,fallfromthebasidiocarp,
and are dispersed by the wind when mature.
7. In a favourable environment, the basidiospores germinate and grow into short-lived
haploid mycelia.

23.27 Key Terms
synapomorphy
23.28 Introduction
What makes an animal an animal?
If animals are a monophyletic taxon, then animals should be able to be deﬁned by synapomor-
phies, (shared, derived characteristics). Ideally, we would NOT deﬁne this or any taxon using
symplesiomorphies (shared ancestral or primitive characteristics) or homoplastic characters
(the independent evolution of similarity, or "convergent evolution"). See pages 654 - 656 and
Fig. 32.6 in your text to review these concepts. As you consider the characteristics listed
below, ask yourself whether or not each is a synapomorphy.
23.29 Characteristics of an Animal
• There is no one universally accepted deﬁnition of an animal. The following treatment
follows your text, beginning on page 876.
• Animals:
• Are multicellular, heterotrophic eukaryotes ...
• Lack the distinctive cell walls of plants & fungi
• Share unique characteristics ...
• Share certain reproductive characteristics ...
• Other commonly used deﬁnitions ...
Animals are multicellular heterotrophic eukaryotes
• Unfortunately, none of these traits is exclusive to animals:
• Plants, fungi, and some algae are multicellular.
• Many bacteria, protists, and all fungi are heterotrophic.
• Everything other than bacteria and archaea are eukaryotic.
• Moreover, all three of these characteristics also apply to fungi.
• However, there is a diﬀerence here between animals and fungi. Animals generally
take in their food through ingestion, or eating and swallowing something. Fungi are
absorptive heterotrophs; they secrete their digestive enzymes onto their food, and then
absorb the resulting nutrients.
Animals share unique characteristics
• Only animals have muscle tissue and nervous tissue.
• Only animals have collagen, a structural protein
• Only animals have the following types of intercellular junctions: (See pages 135 - 139,
Figure 7.15 in your text for more information on these junctions.)
114Characteristics of an Animal
• Tight junctions (sealing function)
• Desmosomes (anchoring function)
• Gap junctions (communication function)
Animals share certain reproductive characteristics
• Most animals reproduce sexually, with the diploid stage dominating.
• In most animals, a small, haploid, ﬂagellated, motile sperm fertilizes a larger, haploid,
nonmotile egg to form a diploid zygote.
• Mitotic division of the zygote yields a blastula stage, followed by a gastrula stage. A
synapomorphy? This feature could be another "unique characteristic" shared by animals.
• Development may be direct to adult form, or there may be a sexually immature stage
(or stages) that are morphologically & ecologically distinct from the adult called a larva
(plural: larvae).
Other commonly used deﬁnitions or characterizations
• It is surprisingly diﬃcult to ﬁnd two texts that agree on a precise deﬁnition of an animal.
Here are a few perspectives from some other texts.
• Animals are multicellular eukaryotes; they are chemosynthetic heterotrophs that ingest
their food.
• Animals are motile, though many are secondarily sessile. Gametes usually are produced
inmulticellularsexorgans, andthezygotepassesthroughembryonicstagesthatinclude
a blastula.
• Animals are organisms that are multicellular, with more than one type of cell. They
are heterotrophic. They reproduce sexually (at least sometimes), with a zygote formed
from two diﬀerent haploid gametes. They go through a developmental stage called a
blastula.
• Animals are not photosynthetic, have no cell wall, and no hyphae or mycelia. (What
would a cladist think of this deﬁnition of the taxon Animalia?)
What kinds of animals are there?
• Kingdom Animalia generally is recognized to have approximately 30 phyla ...
• There is relatively little dispute over the number of phyla recognized; however, the
phylogenetic relationships among the phyla are hotly debated.
• Molecular techniques for assess similarity based on nucleotide sequences in nucleic
acids are providing valuable new perspectives on this question.
• Remember that two animals in diﬀerent phyla generally are considered to be more diﬀerent
from each other than are animals within one phylum (e.g., nematodes are more diﬀerent
from annelids than humans are from sharks).

23.31 Phylum Porifera
Figure 6 Sponges
Name means "pore-bearing".
This phylum consists of the sponges. The number of species is estimated to be between
5,000 and 10,000. All are aquatic and almost all are marine.
Animals in this phyla have no true tissues, which means, for example, that they have no
nervous system or sense organs. Although sponges are multicellular, they are described as
being essentially at a cellular level of organization. They are sessile as adults, but have a
free swimming larva.
Their bodies are porous. They are ﬁlter feeders; water ﬂows in through many small openings,
and out through fewer, large openings. They have inner and outer cell layers, and a variable
middle layer. The middle layer often is gelatinous with spiny skeletal elements (called
spicules) of silica or calcium carbonate, and ﬁbres made of spongin (a form of collagen).
117Multicellular Photosynthetic Autotrophs
Choanocytes are ﬂagellated cells lining the inside of the body that generate a current, and
trap and phagocytize food particles.
Their cells remain totipotent, or developmentally ﬂexible: they can become any type of
cell at any point in the sponge's development. This allows for the great regenerative power
sponges have.
Sponges are an ancient group, with fossils from the early Cambrian (ca. 540 mya) and
possibly from the Precambrian. Sponges often are abundant in reef ecosystems. They
somehow are protected from predators (spicules? bad taste?).
Many organisms are commensals of sponges, living inside them. Some sponges harbor
endosymbiotic cyanobacteria or algae (dinoﬂagellates, a.k.a. "zooxanthellae").
23.32 Phylum Cnidaria
See text pages 886 - 889.
Name comes from the Greek knide- meaning "nettle".
This phylum They have one opening, which serves as both mouth and anus. The body wall
has an outer ectoderm, an inner endoderm, and a variable undiﬀerentiated middle layer
called mesoglea or mesenchyme that may be jelly-like. The mesoglea is NOT considered
to be true mesoderm and so the Cnidaria are described as diploblastic. Tentacles usually
extend from the body wall around the mouth/anus.
118Phylum Cnidaria
Figure 7 Jellyﬁsh Development
14 15
There are two basic body plans: the polyp and the medusa . The polyp is sessile and
attaches to substrate by the aboral end (i.e., the end away from the mouth). The medusa
("jellyﬁsh") is a ﬂoating form, and looks like an upside-down version of the polyp. Some
cnidarians only have the polyp stage, some have only the medusa stage, and others have
both.
14 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polyp
15 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medusa%20%28biology%29
119Multicellular Photosynthetic Autotrophs
The typical life cycle of a cnidarian involves what is called "alternation of generations": an
alternation between an asexual polyp stage and a sexual medusa stage.
The tentacles are armed with cnidae (or nematocysts), small intracellular "harpoons" that
function in defense and prey capture. When ﬁred, the cnidae deliver a powerful toxin that
in some cases is dangerous to humans. The phylum is named after the cnidae.
Cnidarians have no head, no centralized nervous system, and no specialized organs for gas
exchange, excretion, or circulation. They do have a "nerve net."
Many cnidarians have intracellular algae living within them in a mutualistic symbiotic
relationship (Dinoﬂagellates = zooxanthellae). This combination is responsible for much of
the primary productivity of coral reefs.
There are three main classes in the phylum
16
• Class Hydrozoa (hydras and Portugese man-of-war are well-known but atypical examples
of this Class)
17
• Class Scyphozoa (jellyﬁsh)
• The medusa stage is dominant and the polyp stage often is reduced.
18
• Class Anthozoa (sea anemones, most corals)
• No medusa (jellyﬁsh) stage, so sexual reproduction occurs in the polyp stage in this
group. The polyps also can reproduce asexually, which is how individual "corals" grow.
23.33 Phylum Platyhelminthes
See text pages 890 - 893.
Name means "ﬂat worm"
Most members of this phylum are parasitic (ﬂukes and tapeworms), but some are free living
(e.g., planaria). There are about 20,000 species.
They are dorsoventrally compressed (i.e., "ﬂat").
Animals in this phylum are acoelomate, triploblastic, bilaterally symmetrical, and unseg-
mented. Platyhelminths have a simple anterior "brain" and a simple ladder-like nervous
system. Their gut has only one opening. Flatworms have NO circulatory or gas exchange
systems. They do have simple excretory/osmoregulatory structures (protonephridia or "ﬂame
cells").
Platyhelminths are hermaphroditic, and the parasitic species often have VERY complex
reproductive (life) cycles.
There are four main classes of platyhelminths:
19
• Class Turbellaria (mostly free living ﬂatworms, e.g., planaria)

120Phylum Rotifera
20
• Class Monogenea (parasitic ﬂukes)
21
• Class Trematoda (parasitic ﬂukes, e.g., liver ﬂuke and the human blood ﬂuke, Schisto-
soma)
22
• Class Cestoda (tapeworms)
• Cestodes are endoparasitic in the gut of vertebrates. They do not have a mouth or
digestive system.
23.34 Phylum Rotifera
See text page 900
The Rotifers. The name means "wheel bearing," a reference to the corona, a feeding structure
(see below).
They are triploblastic, bilaterally symmetrical, and unsegmented. They are considered
pseudocoelomates.
Most less than 2 mm, some as large as 2 - 3 mm.
Rotifers have a three part body: head, trunk foot. The head has a ciliary organ called the
corona that, when beating, looks like wheels turning, hence the name of the phylum. The
corona is a feeding structure that surrounds the animal's jaws. The gut is complete (i.e.,
mouth & anus), and regionally specialized. They have protonephridia but no specialized
circulatory or gas-exchange structures.
Most live in fresh water, a very few are marine or live in damp terrestrial habitats. They
typically are very abundant. There are about 2,000 species.
Parthenogenesis, where females produce more females from unfertilized but diploid eggs, is
common. Males may be absent (as in bdelloid rotifers) or reduced. When males are present,
sexual and asexual life cycles alternate. Males develop from unfertilized haploid eggs and
are haploid. Males produce sperm by mitosis which can fertilize haploid eggs, yielding a
diploid zygote that develops into a diploid female. Sexual reproduction occurs primarily
when living conditions are unfavorable.
Most structures in rotifers are syncytial ("a mulitnucleate mass of protoplasm not divided into
separate cells," or "a multinucleated cell") and show eutely (here, "constant or near-constant
number of nuclei").
23.35 Phylum Nematoda
See text pages 894 - 895.
Name from the Greek for "thread".
20 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monogenea
21 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trematoda
22 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cestoda
121Multicellular Photosynthetic Autotrophs
This phylum consists of the round worms. There are about 12,000 named species but the
true number probably is 10 - 100 times this!
These animals are triploblastic, bilaterally symmetrical, unsegmented pseudocoelomates.
They are vermiform, or wormlike.
In cross-section, they are round, and covered by a layered cuticle (remember this cuticle !!).
Probably due to this cuticle, juveniles in this phylum grow by molting. The gut is complete.
They have a unique excretory system but they lack special circulatory or gas-exchange
structures. The body has only longitudinal muscle ﬁbers. The sexes are separate.
Nematodes can be incredibly common, widespread, and of great medical and economic
importance. They are parasites of humans and our crops. They can live pretty much
anywhere.
In one rotting apple, there can be up to 90,000 nematodes, and in one tablespoon of coastal
mud, there can be 236 species of nematodes!
Nematodes can be free living or important parasites of our crops, or of humans and other
animals. They have become very important in development studies, especially the species
Caenorhabditis elegans, presumably due to its small size and constancy of cell number
(eutely - 959 cells in C. elegans).
23.36 Phylum Annelida
See text pages 906 - 909.
Name means "ringed", from the Greek annulatus.
This phylum consists of earthworms, leeches, and various marine worms given many diﬀerent
names (e.g., sand worms, tube worms). There are about 12,000 - 15,000 species.
Animals in this phylum are triploblastic, bilaterally symmetrical, segmented coelomates.
Development is typically protostomous. They have a complete circulatory system, and
a well-developed nervous system. Typically, each segment has paired epidermal "bristles"
(setae or chaetae).
Most are marine but they are successful occupants of almost anywhere suﬃcient water is
available. They can be free living, parasitic, mutualistic, or commensalistic.
Major advances of this phylum include the true coelom, segmentation, both longitundinal
and circular muscles, a closed circulatory system and, for most, a more advanced excretory
system (metanephridia).
There are three main classes of Annelids
• Class Oligochaeta (earthworms)
• Class Polychaeta (marine worms)
• Class Hirudinea (leeches)
122Phylum Arthropoda
23.37 Phylum Arthropoda
Figure 8 Arthropods
Name means "jointed feet".
This phylum consists of spiders, ticks, mites, insects, lobsters, crabs, and shrimp, and is the
largest of all the phyla. So far, over 1 million species have been named, and it is likely that
the true number out there is 10 - 100 times greater.
This phylum also includes the extinct trilobites, which were prevalent in the Paleozoic era.
Because of their exoskeletons, these animals fossilized well and over 4000 species have been
named.
These animals are triploblastic, bilaterally symmetrical, segmented, protostome coelomates.
The coelom is generally reduced to portions of the reproductive and excretory systems. They
have an open circulatory system.
Themostnotableadvancementofthisphylumisarigidexoskeleton. Ithasmajorimplications
in these organisms' locomotion, ﬂexibility, circulatory systems, gas exchange systems, and
growth. It also was partially responsible for the ability of the arthropods to move on to land.
There are several major groupings of arthropods:
Major subgroups include:
• The chelicerates (eurytperids, horseshoe crabs, scorpions, spiders, ticks) have clawlike
feeding appendages. They lack antennae and usually have simple eyes.
• The Trilobites...they get their own grouping
123Multicellular Photosynthetic Autotrophs
• The uniramians (centipedes, millipedes, insects) have one pair of antennae and un-
branched (uniramous) appendages.
• The crustaceans (crabs, shrimp, lobsters, barnacles and many others) have two pairs of
antennae and branched (biramous) appendages.
Major Classes Include
• Class Arachnida (mites, scorpions, spiders, ticks)
• Class Diplopoda (millipedes)
• Class Chilopoda (centipedes)
• Class Insecta (insects)
• Class Crustacea (crabs, crayﬁsh, lobsters, shrimp)
23.38 Phylum Mollusca
See text pages 900 - 905.
Name means "soft".
This phylum consists of snails, slugs, bivalves, chitons, squids, octopus, and many others.
About 110,000 species
All molluscs have a similar body plan:
• A muscular foot, usually used for movement.
• A visceral mass, containing most of the internal organs.
• A mantle, a fold of tissue that drapes over the visceral mass and secretes the shell, if
present.
• Most have a radula, or a rasping organ to scrape food.
Molluscs are bilaterally symmetrical, or secondarily asymmetrical. They are coelomates, but
the coelom generally has been greatly reduced; the main body cavity is a hemocoel. Devel-
opment is typically protostomous. The gut is complete with marked regional specialization.
Large, complex, metanephridia (excretion).
Many molluscan life cycles include a trochophore larva. This stage also is characteristic of
annelids.
There are several major classes of molluscs:
• Class Polyplacophora (chitons)
• Class Gastropoda (snails, slugs, nudibranchs)
• Class Bivalvia (clams, mussels, scallops, oysters)
• Class Cephalopoda (squids, octopuses, chambered nautiluses)
23.39 Phylum Echinodermata
Name means "spiny skin"
This phylum consists of sea stars, brittle stars, sea urchins, and sea cucumbers.
124Phylum Chordata
Echinoderms are mostly sessile or very slow moving animals.
As adults, they are radially symmetrical, but in the larval stage, they are bilaterally
symmetrical. They are considered deuterostomes.
Echinoderms are unique in that they have a water vascular system composed of a system
of ﬂuid-ﬁlled canals. These canals branch into the tube feet, which function in feeding,
locomotion, and gas exchange.
There are six major classes of echinoderms:
• Class Asteroidea (sea stars)
• Class Ophiuroidea (brittle stars)
• Class Echinoidea (sea urchins, sand dollars)
• Class Crinoidea (sea lilies)
• Class Holothuroidea (sea cucumbers)
23.40 Phylum Chordata
Name means "the chordates", i.e., these animals have a notochord at some stage in their
lifecycle.
This phylum consists of tunicates, lancelets, and the vertebrates.
There are four major features that characterize the phylum Chordata.
• A notochord, or a longitudinal, ﬂexible rod between the digestive tube and the nerve
cord. In most vertebrates, it is replaced developmentally by the vertebral column. This
is the structure for which the phylum is named.
• A dorsal hollow nerve cord which develops from a plate of ectoderm that rolls into a tube
located dorsal to the notochord. Other animal phyla have solid nerve cords ventrally
located. A chordate nerve cord splits into the central nervous system: the brain and
spinal cord.
• Pharyngeal slits, which allow water that enters through the mouth to exit without
continuing through the entire digestive tract. In many of the invertebrate chordates,
these function as suspension feeding devices; in vertebrates, they have been modiﬁed for
gas exchange, jaw support, hearing, and other functions.
• A muscular, postanal tail which extends posterior to the anus. The digestive tract of
most nonchordates extends the length of the body. In chordates, the tail has skeletal
elements and musculature, and can provide most of the propulsion in aquatic species.
Chordates have a segmented body plan, at least in development. This segmentation evolved
independently from the segmentation of annelids.
Three subphyla make up the phylum Chordata:
• Subphylum Urochordata (tunicates): the adults are enclosed in a tunic made of a carbo-
hydrate much like cellulose. They squirt water out of an excurrent siphon. Urochordates
are characterized by errant (mobile and active) larvae and sessile adults. All are ﬁlter
feeders. The only "chordate" characteristics retained in adult life are the pharyngeal slits.
125Multicellular Photosynthetic Autotrophs
Larval urochordates look more like adult cephlochordates & adult vertebrates than adult
urochordates.
• Subphylum Cephalochordata: Cephalochordates are known as lancelets because of their
blade-like shape; they are also known as amphioxus. They are marine animals and usually
live on the bottom, but can swim.
• Subphylum Vertebrata (vertebrates) ...
Formally, the phyla Urochordata and Cephalochordata are considered invertebrates.
23.40.1 Subphylum Vertebrata
Vertebrata refers to the presence of vertebrae and a vertebral column.
This subphylum includes most of the animals with which most people are familiar.
Vertebrates show extreme cephalization.
The notochord generally is replaced by the cranium & vertebral column in adults.
Neural Crest Cells
Later in development, these give rise to many cells of the body, including some cartilage
cells, pigment cells, neurons & glial cells of the peripheral nervous systems, much of the
cranium, and some of the cells of the endocrine system.
Some scientists would like to classify the neural crest as the fourth germ layer.
Neural crest cells come from the dorsal edge of the neural plate, thus ectoderm.
12624 Chordates
The phylum Chordata includes three subphyla. These include vertebrates and invertebrate
chordates.
24.1 Characteristics
Notochord: the rod-shaped supporting axis found in the dorsal part of the embryos of all
chordates, including vertebrates
Flexible, non-collapsible rod dorsal to the gut/coelom and below the nervous system,
hydrostatic, ﬂuid wrapped in tough connective tissue. As bone does not compact, muscles
tensed on one side result in movement instead of shortening the animal. This allows much
better locomotion than do cilia for larger animals in water, a crucial victory for later success.
Pharyngeal slits: Slits in the pharynx originally used to gather food, water enters the mouth,
passes through pharynx and out gill-like slits, passing through a cavity called an antrium
and then outside. In humans, present only in embryo.
Dorsal nerve cord: A neural tube dorsal to the notochord
Postanal tail: Elongation of the body and notochord, nerve cord and muscles past anus into
tail, early locomotive function led to success.
Non-synapomorphic characteristics (not limited to chordates):
• bisymmetrical (bilateral symmetry)
• segmented muscles and bones
24.2 Subphylum Urochordata
The tunicates are located in this subphylum. Along with the subphylum Cephalochordata,
these two subphyla make up the invertebrate chordates. Only the tunicate larvae have
notochords, nerve cords, and postanal tails. Most adult tunicates are sessile, ﬁlter-feeders
which retain their pharyngeal slits. Adult tunicates also develop a sac, called a tunic,
which gives tunicates their name. Cilia beating within the turnicate cause water to enter
the incurrent siphon. The water enters the body, passes through the pharyngeal slits,
and leaves the body through the excurrent siphon. Undigested food is removed through
the anus. Tunicates are hemaphrodites and can reproduce asexually through budding.In
urochordates notochord is conﬁned to larval tail.These lack cranium. These have an open
type of circulatory system.Excretion is by neural gland,nephrocytes.
127Chordates
24.3 Subphylum Cephalochordata
The lancelets are located in this subphylum. Along with the subphylum Urochordata, these
two subphyla make up the invertebrate chordates. Lancelets receive their name from their
bladelike shape. They resemble ﬁsh but they are actually scaleless chordates only a few
centimeters long. They spend most of their time buried in the sand with their mouths
protruding. Fossils of lancelets have been found to be over 550 million years old.
Dropped out sessile stage, what was the larval stage is now sexually reproductive. Includes
Branchiostoma (“amphioxus”).
24.4 Subphylum Vertebrata
(Vertebra from Latin vertere, to turn). Characterized by separate bones or cartilage blocks
ﬁrmly joined as a backbone. The backbone supports and protects a dorsal nerve cord.
Vertebrates have tissues which are organized into organs which in turn are organized into
organ systems.
All vertebrates share the following characteristics: - segmentation - a true coelom - bilateral
symmetry-cephalization-abackbone-abonyskull-aclosedcirculatorysystem-chambered
heart - two pairs of jointed appendages - tissues organized into organs
Vertebrate Organ Systems: - Nervous System - Circulatory System - Digestive System -
Respiratory System - Reproductive System - Excretory System
• Vertebral column: Not present in higher vertebrate adults. (In humans, the gel-like,
spongy core of the vertebral column is the only remainder. Ruptured or herniated disc is
an injury to this.)
• Cranium: Composite structure of bone/cartilage. Two functions: 1. Supports sensory
organs of head and 2. Encloses or partially encloses the brain.
What evolutionary relationship could we imagine between sessile echinoderms and the higher
chordate animals?
Paedomorphic (child-form) hypothesis: basically, evolution of sexual reproduction in what
had previously been a larval life stage, or the retention of at least one juvenile characteristic
into the adult (adult = sexually reproducing) stage. Some scientists believe that this occurred
in a proto-chordate animal lineage. Maybe chordates (and vertebrates) arose from sessile
(attached) ancestors. Selection in these proto-chordates maybe began to favor more time in
the larval stage, as feeding was more successful or mortality lower in this stage. As larvae
got bigger physics shows that the cilia become less eﬃcient for locomotion, favoring the
undulating motion allowed by a notochord.
Is this hypothesis crazy? A similar example of this today is Epemeroptera, the mayﬂy, which
has almost abandoned its adult stage. Its one-year lifespan is mostly larval with just a brief
day of reproduce-and-die as an adult, which doesn’t even have usable mouthparts.
Tunicate (sea squirt) larva has all four chordate characteristics, although adult sessile
(“attached”).
128Subphylum Vertebrata
24.4.1 Class Agnatha
"jawless ﬁsh"
• Ostracoderms: extinct Agnathans which had primitive ﬁns and massive plates of bony
tissue on their body.
• Cyclostomes: "circle mouth" - a group of Agnathans which is still alive in the form of
lampreys and hagﬁsh.
Appeared approximately 500 million years ago and dominated the oceans for about 100
million years. The ﬁrst group of ﬁsh to appear. They had neither jaws, paired ﬁns, nor
scales, but they were the ﬁrst organisms with a backbone.
Class Acanthodia
"spiny ﬁsh" Appeared about 430 million years ago. An extinct class of ﬁsh that developed
jaws with bony edges. They had internal skeletons made of cartilage and some bone.
Class Placodermi
Appeared about 410 million years ago, dominated the sea for about 50 million years. An
extinct class of ﬁsh with massive heads.
24.4.2 Class Chondrichthyes
"cartilaginous ﬁsh" Appeared about 400 million years ago with bony ﬁsh. Includes sharks,
skates and rays, and chimaeras. Their skeletons are made of cartilage strengthened by the
mineral calcium carbonate.
The main characteristics and distinguishing features of this class: - gills - single-loop blood
circulation - vertebral column - presence of placoid scales on their bodies - internal skeleton
of cartilage - paired, ﬂeshy pectoral and pelvic ﬁns - asymmetrical tail ﬁn prevents sinking -
fatty liver provides neutral buoyancy - visceral clefts present as separate and distinct gills -
no external ear - oviparous - internal fertilization - ectoderms - cold blooded
24.4.3 Class Osteichthyes
"bony ﬁsh" Appeared about 400 million years ago with cartilaginous ﬁsh. Includes about
95% of today's ﬁsh species.
Subclass Sarcopterygii
ﬂeshy-ﬁnned ﬁshes. Fins have bones and muscles, homologous to our limbs.
Order Dipnoi
lung ﬁshes, two groups isolated when continents separated
129Chordates
Order Crossopterygii
includes coelacanths and rhipodistians, gave rise to amphibians, had lungs which evolved
into a swim bladder in bony ﬁshes, and labyrinthodont teeth, characterized by complex
folding of enamel.
• Skeleton made of bone, jaws, ﬁns, most with scales, two-chambered heart.
24.4.4 Class Amphibia
means “both lives”, aquatic larvae, terrestrial adult Amphibians: - Legs - Lungs - Double-
Loop Circulation - Partially Divided Heart - Cutaneous Respiration (Breathes through
Skin)
Order Salientia
frogs (jumping) (aka Anura)
Order Urodela
salamanders (tailed)
Labyrinthodont amphibians: oldest known amphibians, inherited characteristic teeth from
crossopterygii ancestor, had stocky, aquatic larvae.
Amphibians have limbs instead of ﬁns. Girdles and vertebral column now more substantial
and connected, support body on legs.
Lisamphybia: no scales, “smooth”, eggs with no shell, laid in water (water-reliant).
Amphibians gave rise to cotylosaurs, from which arose dinosaurs, turtles, lizards, and
therapsids.
Class Reptilia
amniotic egg allowed freedom from water, shelled egg. (Amnion: protection). Reptiles have
four extra-embryonic membranes:
• Amnion: supports aquatic environment inside egg in ﬂuid sac.
• Allantois: allows gas exchange and elimination of wastes.
• Chorion: gas exchange
• Yolk sac: only one of the four left over from amphibian ancestor
Reptiles cold-blooded, or ectothermic, meaning that their heat come from their environment.
Sometimes deﬁned as all amniotes that are not birds or mammals.
Reptiles can be classiﬁed by skull structure into four groups:
• Anapsid
• Synapsid
• Diapsid
• Euryasid
130Subphylum Vertebrata
Refers to number of holes in the skull. Cotylosaurs had Anapsid skull
Dermatocranium: from bony outer skull structure, precursor to human cranium.
Subclass Anapsidia
Subclass Testudinata
1
turtles , terrapins
Subclass Diapsida
2 3
dinosaurs , snakes , most stuﬀ
Subclass Synapsida
Order Therapsids
Subclass Diapsida
includes Ichthyosaurs, marine reptiles convergent on dolphins; Plesiosaurs, ancient sea
monsters; Squamates, including lizards and snakes; and Thecodonts, which gave rise to
• birds
• dinosaurs
• crocodilians
Dinosaurs: broken into two groups, based on hip structure
• Saurischia: lizard hips (gave rise to birds [!]), ancestrally bipedal
• Ornithischian: bird hips, ancestrally quadripedal
Crocodilians: come from archosaurs, the only extant (still living today) archosaur descendant.
Ancestrally bipedal, secondarily quadripedal.
Synapsids: refers to joined (Greek syn-, together with) parts of skull. Led eventually to
mammals. Synapsid pelycosaur >> therapsid >> mammals
Pelycosaur: Sail-backed dinosaur, legs not spread out like lizard but more pillar-like and
under body, allowing greater activity and competence in motion, pendulum like rather than
constant push-up. Teeth diﬀerentiated into diﬀerent types, for pre-processing of food needed
by higher metabolism. Skull changes, bone histology, suggestions of warm-bloodedness.

131Chordates
Class Aves
arose late Jurassic, early Cretaceous. Feathers, skeleton modiﬁed for ﬂight. Feathers:
epidermal derivative, made of keratin (like ﬁngernails). Carpometacarpis: bears primary
ﬂight feathers, parallel to hand parts. Keeled sternum: breastbone, powerful one needed
to support ﬂight muscles. Strong, light, occasionally hollow bones. All birds lay eggs (as
contrasted to reptiles, which have developed live birthing over 100 independent times.) Why
are there no live-bearing birds? Early birds had teeth, lost them. With mammals, only
exothermic animals.
Archaeopteryx: “ancient wing”, Jurassic bird-reptile, very dinosaur-like. Good fossils found
in Zolenhoﬀen, German sandstone mine with ﬁne sand, shows feathers clearly, found shortly
after Darwin’s publication and used to support his hypothesis. Thick, heavy bones and no
sternum, bony tail, not a good ﬂyer but did have primary ﬂight feathers.
Archaeornithes: includes archaeopteryx.
Paleognathae: gave rise to Australian ﬂightless birds.
Neognathae: remaining live birds.
Class Mammalia
Two unique characteristics, or synapomorphies:
• Hair
• Mammary glands
(don’t fossilize well)
Three skeletal characteristics (fossilize)
• Lower jaw only one bone, the dentary (several in reptiles)
• Three bones in middle ear: malleus, incus, stapes (reptiles have one or two, never three)
• Joint between upper and lower jaws between dentary and squamosal of skull (in reptiles
this joint is between other bones)
Mammals basically have a synapsid skull design inherited from ancestor
Non diagnostic characteristics (not unique to mammals):
• Warm-blooded
• Skin glands: sweat glands and oil-producing sebaceous glands
• Large nasal cavities (because of high metabolism) Clean, warm and humidify air
• Heterodonty (diﬀerentiated teeth)
• Diphiodonty: two sets of teeth: baby and adult (“deciduous” teeth, drop out) (reptile
teeth are continually replaced)
Subclass Protheria
monotremes (Greek mon-, one; and trema, hole), or egg-laying mammals, have one opening
for excretion and urination.
132Subphylum Vertebrata
Subclass Theria
Metatheria: Marsupials (opossum, kangaroo...) Eutheria: Placental mammals (all common
mammals)
Marsupium: (from Greek marsypion, purse or pouch). Gestation period much shorter than
in Eutherian mammals, but after leaving the uterus the tiny oﬀspring crawls into a pouch
where it completes development latched onto a teat.
Recent molecular (read: genetic) evidence suggests that two diﬀerent mammal groups
may have developed live-bearing ability separately. Instead of being a “rough draft” for
placental-style live bearing, perhaps the marsupial pouch approach is another solution to
the same problem. Advantage: in tough times the parent can pitch out the oﬀspring and
increase its own chance of survival.
13325 Tissues and Systems
13526 Epithelial tissue
Comes from various sources, ectodermal or endodermal material. Cell sheet lines a
surface or body cavity. One side, called freesurface or Apical, is exposed to
• animal interior (forming the lumen) or
• exterior of its body cavity.
The other side rests on the basal layer.
Epithelial tissue is not penetrated by blood vessels.
Two categories:
• sheets
• glands
Classiﬁed on two features:
• simple, (a single layer of cells),
• stratiﬁed, (more than one cell layer.)
Cell shape at free surface:
• squamous (broad and ﬂat)
• cuboidal (spherish)
• columnar (tall and thin)
Simple squamous epithelium
usually lines body cavities and vessels,alveoli, glomeruli of kidney; in blood and lymph
vessels called endothelium; in body cavities called mesothelium (serosae): parietal serous
membranes line body wall, visceral serous membranes cover organ
Simple cuboidal epithelium
in ducts like kidney and salivary glands.
Simple columnar epithelium
nonciliated type lines digestive tract, ciliated type lines some regions of uterine tubes and
lungs
Stratiﬁed squamous epithelium
(important) lines mouth, esophagus,and vagina. Cells sometimes dead, ﬂat and keratinized,
making them resistant to abrasion. Stratiﬁed squamous epithelium changes to columnar
squamous epithelium progressively down esophagus to the stomach.
Epidermis
137Epithelial tissue
from epithelium. Below this is dermis, thicker and with blood vessels.
Two specialized epithelia:
• pseudostratiﬁed
• transitional
Pseudostratiﬁed epithelia
lines the trachea (where it is ciliated)and the male urethra (where it is non ciliated), looks
stratiﬁed but not.
Transitional epithelia
found only in bladder and urinary system. As it stretches it appears to go from 6 to 3 cell
layers deep.
Glandular epithelia
(gland: group of cells that excretes something.. mostly derived from epithelium. Glands
are classiﬁed into endocrine and exocrine by where they excrete.
Endocrine glands
secrete hormones into the blood without use of ducts.
Exocrine glands
secrete onto the body surface or into a cavity, thru a duct. Exocrine substances include
sweat, mucous, oil, and saliva. An exocrine gland is the liver, which secretes bile.
13827 Connective tissue
This is a “grab bag” category of diverse tissue types. Functions include binding and
supporting. Types include bone, cartilage, ﬁbrous connective tissue, blood and
adipose (fat) tissue.
If you took away everything in the body except the connective tissue, you’d still be able to
see the basic form of the body.
Form: distinctivecellssurroundedbyacellmatrixmadeofextra-cellularﬁbergrounded
in a ground substance (excluding blood)
Types:
1. connectile connective tissues (can be 1. loose or 2. dense)
2. special connective tissue (includes blood, bones and cartilage).
Fibroblasts form connective tissue proper;
chondoroblasts form cartilage;
osteoblasts form bone;
and blood is formed from various sources.
Ground substance: “unstructured” material that ﬁlls space between cells and contains
ﬁbers. Made of
1. interstitial ﬂuid (bathes cells)
2. proteoglycans (protein core with attached polysaccharides, glycoaminoglycans or GAGs
such as chondroitin sulfate, keratin sulfate, and hyalronic acid, whose consistency is syrupy
to gelatin-like)
3. cell-adhesion proteins (connect connective tissue cells to the ﬁbers).
Fibers of connective tissue:
139Connective tissue
1. Collagen (ﬂexible protein resistant to stretching, tensile strength, most abundant
protein in animals, white)
2. elastin (rubbery, resilient protein, in dermis, lungs, blood vessels, yellow when fresh)
3. andreticulin (like collagen).
Loose connective tissue: found beneath skin, anchors muscles,nerves etc. Include ﬁ-
broblasts, macrophages, mast cells,and adipose cells. Fibers include collagen and
elastic ﬁbers. Ground substance is “syrupy”. Adipose included.
Dense connective tissue: largely densely packed ﬁbers of collagen or elastin regularly
or irregularly arranged. Forms tendons and ligaments, coverings of muscles, capsules
around organs and joints, and dermis of skin.
Cartilage vs. bone
Feature Bone Cartilage
cell type osteocytes chondrocytes
ground substance calcium phosphate chondroitin sulfate
vascularization vascular avascular
micro architecture highly ordered less organized
units called osteons
ﬁbrous sheath peristeum perichondrium
Cartilage: There are three cartilage types:
1. hyaline cartilage
2. ﬁbrocartilage (ﬁbrous cartilage)
3. elastic cartilage
Hyaline cartilage: most widespread cartilage type, in adults forms articular surfaces of
long bones, rib tips, rings of trachea, and parts of skull. Mostly collagen, name refers to
glassy appearance. In embryo, bones form ﬁrst as hyaline cartilage, later ossiﬁes. Found
in tracheal rings. Few collagen ﬁbers.
Fibrous cartilage: have lots of collagen ﬁbers. Found in intervertebral discs, pubic
symphesis. Grades into dense tendon and ligament tissue.
Elastic cartilage: springy and elastic. Found in internal support of external ear and in
epiglottis, yellow when fresh.
Chondrocites (cartilage cells) rely on diﬀusion for nutrients, as cartilage has no direct
blood supply, and no enervation (nerves). Can be loaded with calcium salts.
140Subphylum Vertebrata
Bone: Specialized connective tissue, calcium phosphate arranged in highly ordered unit
called osteon, or Hyvercian system. Concentric rings around central canal with blood
vessels and enervation (nerves). Bone varied, not all vertebrate bone is even cellular. Our
concern: simple pattern for mammals.
Lacuna (spaces in which osteocytes found); canaliculi (little canals) bigger diagonal cells,
layers of bone called lamellae.
Three types of bone cells, ending in
-blast, (mend bone)
-cyte (fortify bone)
-clast (tear down bone)
Classiﬁed by
1. appearance (spongy vs. hard)
2. where found (outside or inside)
3. how it is formed (endochondral cartilage model forms ﬁrst and then is ossiﬁed, and
entramembranous, bone forms directly without cartilage precursor)
Example of endochondral bone formation: long bone begins to ossify from center shaft,
calciﬁed region expands and cuts oﬀ diﬀusion of nutrients as bone replaces cartilage. In
young mammals, secondary ossiﬁcation centers then form at bone ends, growth has stopped
by sexual maturity as all primary bone is ossiﬁed. In other animals, bones continue growing
throughout their lifetime.
Three types of intramembrous bone:
1. dermal bone
2. sessamoid bone
3. perichondral bone.
Dermal bone forms skull, shoulder/pectoral girdle, and integument, descended from dermal
armor of ancestor. Comes from mesoderm, in dermis of skin.
Sessamoid bones: form directly in tendons. Example: kneecap, also in wrist. Deals with
stress.
Perichondral bone means “around cartilage,” forms around cartilage or bone. Func-
tions in bone repair and in ossiﬁcation of endochondral bone.
141Connective tissue
Bone remodeling and repair: bone has mineral structure, and develops tiny fractures,
which, under stress, can lead to larger fractures. To combat this, bone is constantly replaced.
Osteoclasts channel through existing bone, tear down and leave behind osteoblasts
and lacuna, leaving osteocytes. Continually resets mineral structure of bone, and is
preventative maintenance.
When bone broken, callus forms in open ends, periosteum gives rise to new bone with
calcium and new bone matrix, leaves irregular mend. Later, osteoblasts continue ﬁxing over
time and slowly removing imperfection.
14228 Muscle tissue
Mesodermal in origin, muscle has several functions: supply force for movement,restrain
movement, proper posture, act on viscera (internal organs) for peristalsis (moving food
down digestive tract), give body shape, form sphincters, (such as in esophagus, between
stomach and intestine, large and small intestine, in anus), in sheets of muscles, aﬀect air
ﬂow in and out of lungs, line blood vessels and play vital role in circulation.
Secondary roles: heat production (shivering a specialized heat production to supplement
metabolism).
Muscles co-opted to other non-original functions: sharks detect electrical ﬁeld created by ﬁsh
muscles. Some ﬁsh formed electric organs, create current strong enough to repel predators
or stun prey. Other ﬁsh can use ﬁeld as “radar” to see things and communicate with other
animals. (Evolved independently in diﬀerent groups).
Diﬀerent classiﬁcations: by color, (red or white) location, nature of nervous system
control (voluntary or involuntary), embryonic origin, or by general microscopic ap-
pearance (striated, smooth, and cardiac.)
Striated muscle (or skeletal muscle): under voluntary control. Individual cells called
ﬁbers, grouped into fascicle. Myoﬁbrils founding one cell made of even smaller myoﬁl-
aments. Each striated cell very long and multi-nucleated. Fibers joined end to end to
form longer composite ﬁbers. Sarcomeres: repeating units make up myoﬁbrils. Two
kinds of myoﬁlaments, thick kind made up of myosin and thin of actin. Striations visible
in light microscope, smaller part only with electron microscope.
Cardiac muscle: occurs only in heart. Light banding visible under light microscope.
Each band short, principally mononucleate (occasionally dinucleate) often branched, joined
together with intercollated discs. Involuntary. Waves of contraction spread through intercol-
lated discs. Initiated by nerve stimulation or can originate in the heart itself (useful in heart
transplants.)
Smooth muscle: no striations visible with light microscope. Almost entirely visceral
function: digestion, sphincters, urogenital tracts, piloerectory muscles (make hairs stand up),
lungs. Non-voluntary control. Slow and sustained action. Each cell mononucleate, short,
fusiform (spindly) in shape, cells usually uniform in size.
Striated muscle contraction: Muscle broken into units called fascicles, in units of myoﬁbrils.
Repeating units called sarcomeres, consisting of two kinds of myoﬁlaments:
1. thick, myosin ﬁlament
2. thin, actin ﬁlament.
143Muscle tissue
Sarcomere: Thick and thin ﬁlaments interspersed in ordered grid.
Sliding ﬁlament theory: thick and thin ﬁlaments move past each other in opposite
direction, shortening length. Longer muscles contract more rapidly than short ones (see cell
bio for details).
Myosin molecule: two polypeptides twisted together with two globular heads at end.
Myosin ﬁlament: many slender myosin molecules together.
Actin ﬁlament: chain of actin single, tropomyosin strands with repeated globular
troponin, and with actin. All play role in muscle contraction. Myocin heads have sites
that bind to actin. Actin ﬁlaments have many regular sites that can bind to myosin.
Troponin has four sites:
1. one to bind myosin
2. one for actin
3. one for tropomyocin
4. one for calcium ions
Nerve signal reaches muscle, triggers release of chemical signal called neurotransmitter,
that diﬀuses across cell membrane (sarcolimic reticulum) and binds to receptors in it.
Receptor is acetylcholine, ACH. When there is enough nerve signal, the message travels
through t-line to sarcoplasmic reticulum to release calcium ions.
Lacking calcium, tropomyosin site blocked. In calcium, myosin binding sites exposed and
heads bind to actin molecules, delivering force to move ﬁbers in relation to each other.
Myocin head then interacts with ATP to get “recocked”, if myosin still exposed then it
ﬁres again and results in further muscle contration. If there is no further nerve signal,
sarcoplasmic reticulum sequesters Ca+ ions again and no recocking occurs.
Quirari (or curare): known from movies, used in South America, blocks acetylcholine
receptors in cell and causes skeletal paralysis. Victim dies of asphyxiation because he can’t
breathe.
Duchenne's muscular dystrophy: degeneration of sarcolema, plasma membrane of
muscle cell unable to release signal and quickly atrophies.
Fast and slow twitch ﬁbers: vertebrate muscle ﬁber. Terms relative within one group
of animals. Diﬀerences related to diﬀerences in enervation, type of myocin, and actin
activation.
Two parts of force generated by muscle: 1. active component 2. elastic component (energy
stored in muscle when stretched by gravity or another force. Stored in muscle elastic tissue
around tendons. Especially important in limb oscillation, like running, or trunk twisting,
like ﬁsh swimming. Up to 90% of stored elastic energy can be recovered.)
144Subphylum Vertebrata
How does a muscle match its power to its job? Two ways:
1. rate modulation, derived from frequency of nervous stimulation of muscle, force
increases as frequency of stimulation increases up to point of tetanus.
2. selective involvement of motor units, a given neuron enervates a ﬁxed number of
muscle cells, (a motor unit), and force is increased by recruiting more motor units. Motor
units may be small, such as in eye, or larger, like in leg muscle.
How do muscles grow stronger?
1. add more myoﬁlaments, increases cross sectional area by up to 50%, more little ratchets
working
2. proliferation in blood vessels and connective tissue around muscle
Muscle strength is relative to cross sectional area, not length. Not always feasible to add
more cross sectional area.
Pinnate ﬁbers: oriented obliquely (Y-shaped) to minimize muscle mass, in certain circum-
stances, like calf muscle. Spreads muscle out.
Velocity of shortening greater in long muscle than short. Why? Contraction tied to relation
between ﬁbers, and to total length of muscle. Both long and short muscles reach same
percentage of contraction in same unit time, but distance covered by the longer muscle is
greater.
Synergist muscles: muscles work together to produce motion in same general direction.
Bicep shares work with brachialis.
Antagonist muscles: muscles that oppose each other. Bicep pulls forearm in, triceps pulls
it back out.
Origin vs. insertion: origin is the end of the muscle that more ﬁxed in its attachment to
the body. The more movable end called insertion.
Fixators: muscles that act to stabilize a joint or lever system. Like upper arm when you
clench your ﬁst hard.
Flexors and extensors: applied mainly to limbs. Flexor bends one part relative to another
about limb, extensor straightens it.
Adductor and abductor: adductor draws a limb toward the ventral surface. Abductor
moves limb away from ventral surface. (Adduct: drawn toward; abduct: carry away).
14529 Vertebrate digestive system
Functions to break down food into molecules small enough to absorb, or pass across digestive
membrane.
Digestive tract: tube extending from lips of mouth to anus or cloacae in bird, reptile or
monotreme.
Lumanal glands: empty into inner body cavity (lumen: inner surface).
Tract divided into three main regions: 1. buccal cavity 2. pharynx 3. alimentary canal
Alimentary canal divided into four regions: 1. esophagus 2. stomach 3. small intestine 4.
large intestine
Accessory digestive glands, outside digestive tract proper, secrete into lumen of tract
through ducts. Includes the salivary glands, liver and pancreas.
Buccalcavity, whichincludespalateandtongue, developsfrominfoldingofstomadeum,
or second opening of blastula, whereas the rest of the digestive tract develops from the
primitive gut.
Teeth: capture and hold prey. In mammals in particular further process and break down
food into small particles, increasing surface area available for enzymatic action.
Tooth anatomy: 1. crown projects above gum, 2. root below gum, 3. enamel is outer
coating of crown, hardest surface in body, of epideral origin 4. dentin, below enamel,
bone-like and forms bulk of tooth, is harder than bone and contains nerves and blood vessels.
(Remember that mammals are heterodontic, with diﬀerent types of teeth).
Pharynx: air passage for adult, gill slits in embryo. Important in lower vertebrates, site of
gills. Features derived from pharyngeal region: ﬁrst pharyngeal pouch gives rise to parts
of the ear, other pouches give rise to various other structures.
Alimentary canal: epithelium lines lumen, glands secrete into lumen, longitudinal and
circular muscles help digestive movements (peristalsis).
Esophagus: tube carries food from mouth to stomach. Expands to ﬁt large bolus (lump
of chewed food). Secretes mucus for lubrication. Birds have crop for storage, enlargement
of esophagus.
Epiglottis: keeps food out of air tube, an evolutionary “kludge,” or ﬁx.
Stomach. Absorbs water, alcohol, nutrients, uses gastric juice with enzymes, mucous, HCl,
released by chief and parietal cells (release protein enzymes) in gastric pits. Rugae: folds
of stomach, disappear when full. Sphincter at both ends of stomach, control food passage.
Chyme: semi-digested food released to small intestine.
147Vertebrate digestive system
Small intestine: three regions, duodenum, jejunum, and ileum.
Duodenum site of most intestinal digestion. Jejunum and ileum do most of intestinal
absorption. Ileum ends with another sphincter, ileocolic valve or ileosecal valve. Structure:
Circular folds covered with villi (singular is villus).
Villi: ﬁnger-likecellular projections, covered withmicrovilli, tinyprojectionswhichincrease
surfacearea. Increasessurfaceareaby900x, speedsdigestion(breakdown)andabsorption
(taking in nutrients).
Large intestine: larger diameter, shorter length than small intestine. No villi. In mammals,
forms large gentle loop, colon, empties into straight region, rectum, empties into outside
world through anal sphincter. Colon: absorbs water left over, also absorbs vitamins released
by bacteria which live there (vitamin K).
Food: made up of 1. proteins, 2. fats, 3. carbohydrates 4. ﬁbrous material.
Digestive system breaks foods down. Proteins must be broken to amino acids to be
absorbed. Polysaccharides to monosaccharides, lipids to fatty acids and monoglyc-
erides to absorb.
Salivary glands in mouth, saliva contains mucous, salt and a few enzymes (amalase, begins
starch breakdown). Snake venom from oral gland, mixture of toxins and digestive enzymes.
Breaks down blood vessels and disables nervous system.
Stomach enzymes: released in inactive form, zymogene, converts to active form in lumen
of gut. Transformation is triggered by another enzyme, or the stomach’s low pH. Pepsin
secreted as pepsinogen (-ogen means primitive form). Stomach glands secrete up to two or
three liters a day of gastric juice, which is reabsorbed.
Chyme released to duodenum.
Small intestine has two major accessory glands: 1. pancreas 2. liver
Pancreas has endocrine and exocrine functions, releases large amounts of carbonate to
neutralize acidic chyme, as intestinal enzymes work in neutral pH, and stuﬀ to break down
lipids and starch (zymogens, like tripsin)
Liver releases bile. Bile made from cholesterol, stored in gall bladder, released in
duodenum, emulsiﬁes fats.
Emulsify: keeps fats in tiny drops, which are suspended, increasing surface area and action
of lipases. Protein and carbohydrates absorbed in intestine, taken to liver for processing.
Fatty acids go to lymphatic system
Appendix: vestigial remnant. Much variation in digestive systems within mammals:
herbivore, carnivore, insectivore, non-ruminant herbivore.
Rumen: four-chambered stomach of animals like cows (ruminant herbivores). Cellulose
resistant to digestion, rely on microorganisms to break down cellulose. Some bacteria,
protists and fungi can break down cellulose, almost no animals can. Bacteria break down
cellulose in rumen, to be taken back to the mouth to chew their cud (ruminate). Later cow
swallows to proceed with digestion. (Horses not like this).
148Subphylum Vertebrata
Coprophagy: rabbits and other animals eat their own feces for the nutritious products of
the cecum.
14930 Circulatory system
Circulatory system functions
1. Transportation
a. Respiration: gas exchange (O2 and CO2), overcomes limited rate
of
diﬀusion
b. Nutrition:<br>
c. Excretory: (remove metabolic wastes)<br>
2. Regulation
a. Transport hormones<br>
b. Regulate body temperature<br>
c. Protection<br>
i. Blood clotting<br>
ii. Immune system (carries white blood cells)
Vasodilation: allows heat loss across epidermis, as seen in elephant ears, takes more blood
to surface of body, sweating may accompany
Countercurrent heat exchange: used by dolphins in ﬁns to conserve heat in cold water.
Veins surround an artery, and blood returning to body absorbs heat from blood traveling
out from body to ﬁn, minimizing heat loss. Used by dogs in feet, etc.
Blood made of 1. plasma and 2. formed cellular elements (red and white blood cells,
and platelets).
Plasma makes up 55% of blood volume. Cellular elements make up the other 45%.
Plasma makeup: 90% water, 7-8% soluble proteins (albumin maintains blood osmotic
integrity, others clot, etc.) 1% electrolytes 1% elements in transit
Red blood cell (erythrocyte): contains hemoglobin, functions in oxygen transport. In
mammals, red blood cells lose nuclei on maturation, and take on biconcave, dimpled, shape.
No self repair, live 120 days. About 1000x more red blood cells than white blood cells.
About 7-8 micrometers in diameter.
151Circulatory system
Hematocrit: proportion of blood volume that is occupied by cells, about 43% in humans
on average. 48% for men and 38% for women.
White blood cells (leukocytes): Nucleated, about 10-14 micrometers in diameter, com-
monly amoeboid, escape circulatory system in capillary beds. Include basophils, eosinophils,
neutrophils, monocytes, B- and T-cell lymphocytes.
Platelets (thrombocytes) Membrane bound cell fragments in mammals, no nucleus. In
non-mammals, platelet role replaced by nucleated cells. Accumulate at site of broken blood
vessels, form clots. Bud oﬀ special cells in bone marrow. 1-2 micrometers in diameter. 7-8
day life span, 1/10 or 1/20 as abundant as white blood cells.
Arteries: carry blood away from heart. Smallest tubes called arterioles, feed blood to
capillaries.
Veins: return blood to heart. Smallest veins called venules.
Structure of arteries and veins, listed from inside (lumen) out: 1. epithelium (endothelium),
2. elastic connective tissue ﬁbers, 3. smooth muscle, 4. connective tissue. Arteries
have thicker elastic layer than do veins.
Capillaries, where exchange of materials occurs, are very thin and narrow, and red blood
cells pass through single ﬁle. Capillaries are tiny but numerous, and their total volume is
greater than that of supplying arteries.
Blood velocity drops in capillaries, picks back up in veins. Pressure highest in arteries, lower
in capillaries and arteries.
Osmotic pressure draws interstitial ﬂuid from blood in arterioles, but replaces it in venules.
One-way valves mean that blood can ﬂow only one way, works with residual blood pressure
and compression by skeletal muscles. Low pressure in thoracic cavity caused by breathing
also helps move blood.
Lymphatic system: part of the immune system, a one-way, or open, system. Takes up
interstitial ﬂuid not taken up by venules.
Lymphatic structures:
1. lymphatic capillaries
2. lymphatic vesicles
3. lymph nodes
4. lymphatic organs (spleen and thymus)
Lymph: movement in mammals through one-way valves, similar to blood movement in
veins. (Some non-mammals have lymphatic hearts of unknown embryonic origin. Frogs and
salamanders have several.) Lymph rejoins cardiovascular system into a large vein near the
heart via single large thoracic duct.
152Subphylum Vertebrata
As lymph passes through system, passes lymphocytes, second part of immune system.
Heart: pumps blood, design varies between animals. In adult mammal,four chambers form
two separate circulations
1. pulmonary circulation to and from lungs and
2. systemic circulation to and from tissues of body.
Everything in the heart comes in pairs: 2 atria, 2 ventricles (left and right).
Diagrams usually drawn as though animal were on its back.
Pattern of blood ﬂow through heart: blood returning from major veins (vena cava)
enters rightatrium, contraction there delivers blood to rightventricle through atricuspid
valve, one of atrial ventricular valves (AV valve). Contraction of right ventricle drives blood
through semi lunar valve into pulmonary circuit and to lungs.Blood return to heart in
pulmonary veins, is oxygenated. Goes to left atrium, which contracts and delivers blood
to left ventricleby way of aortic semi-lunar valve, then goes to systemic circulation.
Both atria and ventricles contract in unison, left is more powerful than right (to all system
vs. just lungs).
Systole: heart contraction, diastole: heart relaxed
Timing of heart contraction: ventricles rebound to relaxed shape (diastole), and semi-
lunar valves close. Both atria(singular: atrium) ﬁll with blood coming from pulmonary
and systemic circulations.Pressure rises in the atria and blood begins to move into the
ventricles.The atria then contract, forcing more blood into the ventricles. There is a pause,
then ventricles contract. This raises ventricle pressure, atrio-ventricular(AV) valves
shut and semi-lunar valves open, forcing blood from the left ventricle into the major arteries
and from the right ventricle into the aorta.
Control for this action doesn’t rely on nervous stimulation, has intrinsic rhythmicity, called
myogenic. This is the case in mammal as well as in mollusk hearts. Other animals have
neurogenic hearts that rely on nervous stimulation for heart action, originating in the
cardiac ganglion.
The rhythmicity of mammalian heart relies on the sino-atrial (SA)node, or pacemaker.
This is a phylogenic (based on evolutionary history) remnant of an early vertebrate heart
that had one more chamber than modern hearts.
How the heart contracts: waves of depolarization start in SA node and spread
through atria. Connectile tissue pauses the spread of depolarization at the atrial ventricular
node. Signal continued by bundle branches to lower ventricle, begins to stimulate
heart to contract. Contraction starts at bottom of heart at heart apex,then signals spread
through heart.
Medulla (in the brain) controls autonomic nervous system. (The medulla is part of
the brain, is continuous with the spinal cord, and controls involuntary actions of the
body). Sympatheticcardiacacceleratorconnectstospinalcord, usesnorepinephrine
to signal. Parasympathetic cardio-inhibitory center reaches heart through Vagus
153Circulatory system
nerve, usesacetylcholine to signal. Hyperpolarizes membrane to inhibit heart contraction.
(Autonomic nervous system: two parts working in contra to control from both sides.)
Dominant eﬀect here is inhibitory. If we cut Vagus nerve, heart rate promptly rises about
25 bpm.
15431 Respiratory system
In humans and other animals, for example, the anatomical features of the respiratory system
include airways, lungs, and the respiratory muscles.
Other animals, such as insects, have respiratory systems with very simple anatomical features,
and in amphibians even the skin plays a vital role in gas exchange.
Plants also have respiratory systems but the directionality of gas exchange can be opposite
to that in animals. The respiratory system in plants also includes anatomical features such
as holes on the undersides of leaves known as stomata.
In mammals, the diaphragm divides the body cavity into the
abdominal cavity: contains the viscera (e.g., stomach and intestines)
thoracic cavity: contains the heart and lungs.
Respiratory tree: terminates in alveolus, alveoli. Respiratory bronchioles branch into
alveolar ducts and into alveoli. Alveolus: microscopic air sacs, 300 million of these in human
lungs. Total surface area large. Gas diﬀuses micrometer, very tiny distance.
Nervous System
Composed of tissues designed to integrate sensory information and direct a coordinated
response to the environment.
1
Basic unit of the nervous system is the neuron , a highly specialized cell that uses both
electrical and chemical processes to communicate. Neurons "listen" to sensory organs or
other neurons, and can simultaneously "hear" from 1 to hundreds of inputs simultaneously.
Likewise, a neuron can "talk" to other neurons or cells that can create an action, like muscle
cells or glands.
Neurons are outnumbered in the nervous system by glia. Glia were once thought to only play
a supportive role in helping neurons survive; today we know that they also are important
participants in the communication process. Glial cells include astrocytes, ependymal cells,
and a cell that has a macrophage like function. There are also oligodendocytes and Schwann
cells that provide a myelin sheath.
1 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron
155Respiratory system
31.1 Neuron structure
Figure 9 Neuron
• Dendrite will receive information from other axons
• Stoma is the neuron body and contains typical cell parts including the mitochondria and
nucleus. This is where neurotransmitters are synthesized.
• Axon hillock is where the cell body and the axon meet.
• Axon is surrounded by myelin.
• Contains nodes of Ranvier
Types of axons include unipolar, bipolar, pseudopolar.
Action potentials results from excitatory stimuli received from the dendrites that results
in a signal that travels down the axon. On the cellular level, there is a Na+ inﬂux via
channels causing a depolarization of the cell. Once those channels close, the slower opening
K+ channels will open resulting in hyperpolarization by the cell.
Synapses
Neurotransmitters allow a chemical signal to be sent from one neuron to the other. Neuro-
transmitters must bypass a physical gap called the synapse. Examples of neurotransmitters
include acetylcholine, epinephrine, and glutamate.
Example : Neuromuscular synapses
156Central nervous system
Circuits / Nuclei / Ganglia
31.2 Central nervous system
Central nervous system includes the brain and the spinal cord.
Brain There are four lobes of the brain.
• Frontal lobe - decision making
• Parietal lobe
• Temporal lobe
• Occipital lobe - vision
The areas of the brain are also dedicated to diﬀerent functions.
• Precentral gyrus
• Postcentral gyrus
Protection The CNS is protected by three layers - the pia mater, the arachnoid mater, and
the dura mater. Protection also comes from the circulation of cerebral spinal ﬂuid (CSF).
CSF helps to ﬂoat the brain and also provide nutrients to both the brain and the spinal
cord. CSF is synthesized from the choroid plexus of the lateral ventricles. In total, there are
four ventricles - 2 lateral ventricles, a 3rd, and 4th ventricle.
31.3 Peripheral nervous system
The peripheral nervous system is broken down into two sub-systems, the somatic nervous
system and the autonomic nervous system.
ANS - Autonomic Nervous System The ANS has two components - parasympathetic and
sympathetic.
The sympathetic nervous system is the "ﬁght or ﬂight" or fright response and results in an
increased heart rate, increased rate of breathing, and an elevated blood glucose level. There
is also decreased digestion. The second neurotransmitter is epinephrine. In this case, the
ﬁrst neuron is short and the second neuron is long.
The parasympathetic nervous system is the rest and digest system.
Drugs must be able to pass the blood brain barrier to have an eﬀect on the CNS. Drugs act
by aﬀecting the neuron and how likely it is to ﬁre an action potential.
Stroke occurs when there is a blood clot that goes to the brain and prevent blood ﬂow.
15732 Sensory systems
Categorized by
1. nature of stimulus, such as mechanical, chemicalor light stimulus, and
2. where stimulus received, such as outside (exteroceptors,such as the eye and
skin temp receptors) or insidebody (interoceptors, such as blood body tem-
perature receptors).
Transduction of sensory input into signal. Means to “carry across”,signal transduced, or
carried, from environment into nervous signal.
Three sensory processes we cover
1. taste and smell (chemoreception)
2. gravity and movement
3. light
32.1 Taste and smell (chemoreception)
Found in mammal nose and mouth, ﬂy feet, ﬁsh bodies, moth antennae.
Papilla: bumps on tongue, contain taste buds down between. Sweet, sour, salty and bitter.
Some act directly by ion channels, others act indirectly. Other “taste” sensations really
smell.
Smell: received in nasopharynx. Airborne molecules go into solution on moist epithelial
surface of nasal passage. Approximately 1000 genescode for sensory neuron receptors. “Fried
onions” odor not one receptor but a mixture of many odors registered in our mind as one.
Very sensitive, habituates rapidly (don’t notice a smell after a bit). Odor sensation has
relatively unﬁltered root to higher brain centers.
Snakes more chemosensory focused than us.
32.2 Response to gravity and movement
Registered in inner ear. Three semicircular canals loop in three planes at right angles
to each other, responsible for transduction of movement messages. Method: hair cells
159Sensory systems
deformed by gelatinous membrane. Vestibular apparatus, gives us perception of gravity
and movement. Due to physical response, not chemical binding.
Cochlea: bony, coil shaped part of inner ear, where hearing occurs.
Sound enters throughauditory canal, vibratestympanic membrane,moving three bones
of middle ear (malleus, incus, and stapes)against oval window opening in front of cochlea.
Cochlea has three ﬂuid ﬁlled ducts, one of these the organ of Corti. Sound waves in air
go to vibration in organ of Corti; ﬂuid tickles hair cells, which register the movement
along basilar membrane in cochlea. Diﬀerent sound frequencies move diﬀerent portions
of basilar membrane. Hearing loss due to loss of hair cells.Humans normally smell more
than 300 odors in a day(Facts and Truth).
Transduction of sound accomplished throgh physical deformation,not chemical binding.
32.3 Vision
Light enters pupil, focused by lensonto retina.
Sclera: hardened part behind retina.
Optic nerves and neurons attached to retina. Blind spot where optic nerve attaches, has
no receptors.
Two types of photoreceptors
1. rods - black and white low-light vision, 100 million in each retina in humans.
2. cones - color vision, work best under better illumination. 3 million in each retina.
Fovia: region of most acute vision, has most of the cones, few rods.
Transduction process of light to signal a molecular change, to light absorbing molecule
called photopigment. Located in outer parts of rods and cones in pigment discs. The rod
photopigment is called rhodopsin,cone has three photopigments, called photopsins. This
molecular change initiates pathways to result in action potential in downstream neuron
leading to vision center in brain.Parul Godika
Each of the three photopsins has a diﬀerent peak of sensitivity: blue,green or red, and
changes isometric form (from cisto trans) based on light from a particular wavelength
range. Color blindness:inherited lack of one or more types of these cones. Gene carried on X
chromosome, therefore more common in men than women.
32.4 Homeostasis
Is a very important part of everyone's and everything's lives. Deﬁned as dynamic con-
stancy of internal environment, maintenance of a relatively stable environment inside
an organism usually involving feedback regulation.
160Osmotic environments and regulations
Homeostasis is maintained in face of
1. a varying external environment, or
2. a non-ideal, constant external environment (as with the penguin).
Deals with temperature, pH, chemical concentrations,pressure, oxygen levels.
Occurs through negative feedback loops.
Various forms: simple thermostat in house turns oﬀ heater when above a certain temperature
and on when below a certain temperature Involves stimulus, sensor,integrating center,
eﬀector and response.
More eﬃcient control has two sensors and two eﬀectors. Can be antagonistic to each
other, such as, one cools, the other heats.
Precise control through proportional control, not all-or-none, furnace comes on a little
bit if the house a bit cold. Examples in humans: vasoconstriction, change in metabolic rate,
shivering. Physiological responses for high body temp: blood goes to body surface, sweating,
behavioral changes (get out of sun).
Positive feedback loop: eﬀector increases deviation from set point. Ampliﬁes reaction.
Like blood clotting process, uterine contraction during childbirth. Negative feedback must
exist at some point for control.
32.5 Osmotic environments and regulations
1. Marine invertebrates
a) fully marine invertebrates (not intertidal or estuarine) osmoconformers (set
internal environment same as environment, no net ﬂow of ions) in a stenohaline
(narrow non-changing salt level) environment
b) Coastal, intertidal, estuarine (ion levels ﬂuctuate) invertebrates.Partly osmo-
confomers, partly osmoregulators in a euryhaline (wide salt level variation)
environment (ex: shore crab, regulates sometimes when salt levels in environment
get real low).
2. Freshwater animals. Here, environment has lower solute concentrations than do
living organisms so water tends to ﬂow in and solutes out.
a) Freshwater ﬁsh (bony) dilute urine, and gills actively take up ions (NaCl)
b) Freshwater invertebrates: same situation as freshwater ﬁsh but with diﬀerent
structures
c) Freshwater amphibians: active uptake of salts across their skin
3. Marine ﬁshes: Here the environment has a higher solute concentration than does
the organism so water tends to ﬂow out and ions in.
a) Bony ﬁshes: actively secrete salts (NaCl) across gills, absorb water across gut
wall, their kidney (unlike mammalian kidney) is unable to generate concentrated
urine so glomerulus is reduced, active tubular secretion of MgSO
4
b) cartilaginous ﬁshes (and coelacanth): blood retains urea and trimethylamineoxide
to increase its osmolality to that of seawater
161Sensory systems
4. Terrestrial animals: here problem is loss of water to a drier environment, and
regulation of salt levels.
a) water loss adaptations
b) concentrated exception of salts and nitrogenous wastes
Hypoosmotic: having less osmotic potential than nearby ﬂuid
Hyperosmotic: having more osmotic potential than nearby ﬂuid
Isoosmotic: having equal osmotic potential than nearby ﬂuid
Glomerulus: reduces volume of kidney
Fish started in salt water, spread to fresh water, later reinvaded salt-water environment.
Terrestrial animal water sources:
1. drinking
2. moist foods
3. from breakdown of metabolic molecules like fats. (Desert kangaroo rats get 90% of their
water from metabolism.)
Secretion of nitrogenous wastes: from metabolism of amino acids, amino group has to be
removed in one of three basically interchangeable chemical forms:
1. ammonia (aquatic life)
2. urea (mammals)
3. uric acid (birds)
Ammonia very toxic, soluble, and cheap to produce. Easy to expel for bony ﬁshes.
Urea: low toxicity, good solubility, more costly to lose as it contains other groups on it.
Must be released in solution, water cost.
Uric acid (white part of bird poo) low toxicity, insoluble, secreted with little water loss,
more costly side groups lost than the others.
Mammalian kidney: Structure: ﬁst-sized organ in lower back. About 1/5 of blood from
aorta at any time is passing through kidneys. Blood passes through kidney many times a
day.
Nephron: structural and functional unit of kidney.
Bowmans capsule: funnel-like opening, contains primary ﬁlter, the glomerulus.
Proximal convoluted tubule: receives stuﬀ from Bowmans capsule.
Loop of Henle: descends and ascends.
162Osmotic environments and regulations
Vasa recta: capillaries that surround the Loop of Henle.
Glomerulus: main ﬁlter of the nephron, located within the Bowman's capsule
Kidney properties and processes important to its function
1. Active transport of solutes from one ﬂuid to another against a concentration gradient,
+
Na actively transported out of ﬁltrate by cells of the thick ascending loop of Henley into
the interstitial ﬂuid
2. Passive movement of solutes and water from one ﬂuid to another(down a concen-
tration gradient), movement of water and NaCl out of descending loop of Henley into
interstitial ﬂuid.
3. Diﬀerential permeability of cells in diﬀerent regions of the nephron to movement
of water and solutes, ascending thick look is impermeable to water, descending portion is
permeable to water
4. Hormonal control of that permeability, antidiuretic hormone(ADH) increases
permeability of collecting due to water, resulting in reduced volume of ﬁltrate and thus
more concentrated urine.
5. Increasing solute concentration in the interstitial ﬂuid of the kidney, from the
cortex to the deepest medulla, maintained by a countercurrent multiplier mechanism

11 Getting Started
32 Biology - The Life Science
The word biology means, "the science of life", from the Greek bios, life, and logos, word
or knowledge. Therefore, Biology is the science of Living Things. That is why Biology is
sometimes known as Life Science.
1
The science has been divided into many subdisciplines, such as botany , bacteriology,
2 3
anatomy , zoology, histology, mycology, embryology, parasitology, genetics , molecular biol-
4 5 6 7
ogy , systematics, immunology, microbiology , physiology, cell biology , cytology, ecology ,
and virology. Other branches of science include or are comprised in part of biology studies,
8
including paleontology , taxonomy, evolution, phycology, helimentology, protozoology, en-
tomology, biochemistry, biophysics, biomathematics, bio engineering, bio climatology and
anthropology.
2.1 Characteristics of life
Not all scientists agree on the deﬁnition of just what makes up life. Various characteristics
describe most living things. However, with most of the characteristics listed below we can
think of one or more examples that would seem to break the rule, with something nonliving
being classiﬁed as living or something living classiﬁed as nonliving. Therefore we are careful
not to be too dogmatic in our attempt to explain which things are living or nonliving.
• Living things are composed of matter structured in an orderly way where simple
molecules are ordered together into much larger macromolecules.
An easy way to remember this is GRIMNERD C All organisms; - Grow, Respire, Interact,
Move, Need Nutrients, Excrete (Waste), Reproduce,Death, Cells (Made of)
• Living things are sensitive, meaning they are able to respond to stimuli.
• Living things are able to grow, develop, and reproduce.
• Living things are able to adapt over time by the process of natural selection.
9
• All known living things use the hereditary molecule, DNA .

5Biology - The Life Science
• Internal functions are coordinated and regulated so that the internal environment of a
10
living thing is relatively constant, referred to as homeostasis .
11
Living things are organized in the microscopic level from atoms up to cells . Atoms are
12 13
arranged into molecules, then into macromolecules , which make up organelles , which
work together to form cells. Beyond this, cells are organized in higher levels to form entire
14
multicellular organisms. Cells together form tissues , which make up organs, which are
part of organ systems, which work together to form an entire organism. Of course, beyond
this, organisms form populations which make up parts of an ecosystem. All of the Earth's
ecosystems together form the diverse environment that is the earth.
Example:-
sub atoms, atoms, molecules, cells, tissues, organs, organ systems, organisms, population,
community, eco systems
2.2 Nature of science
Science is a methodology for learning about the world. It involves the application
of knowledge.
The scientiﬁc method deals with systematic investigation, reproducible results, the
formation and testing of hypotheses, and reasoning.
Reasoning can be broken down into two categories, induction (speciﬁc data is used to
develop a generalized observation or conclusion) and deduction (general information leads
to speciﬁc conclusion). Most reasoning in science is done through induction.
Science as we now know it arose as a discipline in the 17th century.
2.3 Scientiﬁc method
The scientiﬁc method is not a step by step, linear process. It is an intuitive process, a
methodology for learning about the world through the application of knowledge. Scientists
must be able to have an "imaginative preconception" of what the truth is. Scientists will
often observe and then hypothesize the reason why a phenomenon occurred. They use all
of their knowledge and a bit of imagination, all in an attempt to uncover something that
might be true. A typical scientiﬁc investigation might go like so:
You observe that a room appears dark, and you ponder why the room is dark. In an attempt
to ﬁnd explanations to this curiosity, your mind unravels several diﬀerent hypotheses. One
hypothesis might state that the lights are turned oﬀ. Another hunch might be that the
room's lightbulb has burnt out. Worst yet, you could be going blind. To discover the truth,
10 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/homeostasis
11 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cell
12 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/macromolecule
13 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/organelle
14 http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/General%20Biology%2FTissues
6Scientiﬁc method
you experiment. You feel your way around the room and ﬁnd a light switch and turn it on.
No light. You repeat the experiment, ﬂicking the switch back and forth. Still nothing. That
means your initial hypothesis, the room is dark because the lights are oﬀ, has been rejected.
You devise more experiments to test your hypotheses, utilizing a ﬂashlight to prove that
you are indeed not blind. In order to accept your last remaining hypothesis as the truth,
you could predict that changing the light bulb will ﬁx the problem. If all your predictions
succeed, the original hypothesis is valid and is accepted. In some cases, however, your
predictions will not occur, in which you'll have to start over. Perhaps the power is oﬀ.
Figure 1 How Science is Done
A diagram that illustrates scientiﬁc investigation
Scientists ﬁrst make observations that raise a particular question. In order to explain the
observed phenomenon, they develop a number of possible explanations, or hypotheses. This
is the inductive part of science, observing and constructing plausible arguments for why
7Biology - The Life Science
an event occurred. Experiments are then used to eliminate one of more of the possible
hypotheses until one hypothesis remains. Using deduction, scientists use the principles of
their hypothesis to make predictions, and then test to make sure that their predictions are
conﬁrmed. After many trials (repeatability) and all predictions have been conﬁrmed, the
hypothesis then may become a theory.
Quick Deﬁnitions
Observation - Quantitative and qualitative measurements of the world.
Inference - Deriving new knowledge based upon old knowledge.
Hypotheses - A suggested explanation.
Rejected Hypothesis - An explanation that has been ruled out through experimentation.
Accepted Hypothesis - An explanation that has not been ruled out through excessive
experimentation and makes veriﬁable predictions that are true.
Experiment - A test that is used to rule out a hypothesis or validate something already
known.
Scientiﬁc Method - The process of scientiﬁc investigation.
Theory - A widely accepted hypothesis that stands the test of time. Often tested, and
usually never rejected.
The scientiﬁc method is based primarily on the testing of hypotheses by experimentation.
This involves acontrol, or subject that does not undergo the process in question. A scientist
will also seek to limit variables to one or another very small number, single or minimum
number of variables. The procedure is to form a hypothesis or prediction about what you
believe or expect to see and then do everything you can to violate that, or falsify the
hypotheses. Although this may seem unintuitive, the process serves to establish more ﬁrmly
what is and what is not true.
A founding principle in science is a lack of absolute truth: the accepted explanation is the
most likely and is the basis for further hypotheses as well as for falsiﬁcation. All knowledge
has its relative uncertainty.
Theories are hypotheses which have withstood repeated attempts at falsiﬁcation. Common
theories include evolution by natural selection and the idea that all organisms consist of
cells. The scientiﬁc community asserts that much more evidence supports these two ideas
than contradicts them.
8Charles Darwin
2.4 Charles Darwin
Figure 2
Charles Darwin is most remembered today for his contribution of the theory of evolution
through natural selection.
The seeds of this theory were planted in Darwin's mind through observations made on a
ﬁve-year voyage through the New World on a ship called the Beagle. There, he studied
fossils and the geological record, geographic distribution of organisms, the uniqueness and
relatedness of island life forms, and the aﬃnity of island forms to mainland forms.
Upon his return to England, Darwin pondered over his observations and concluded that
evolution must occur through natural selection. He declined, however, to publish his work
because of its controversial nature. However, when another scientist, Wallace, reached similar
conclusions, Darwin was convinced to publish his observations in 1859. His hypothesis
revolutionized biology and has yet to be falsiﬁed by empirical data collected by mainstream
scientists.
2.5 After Darwin
Since Darwin's day, scientists have amassed a more complete fossil record, including
microorganisms and chemical fossils. These fossils have supported and added subtleties
to Darwin's theories. However, the age of the Earth is now held to be much older than
Darwin thought. Researchers have also uncovered some of the preliminary mysteries of
the mechanism of heredity as carried out through genetics and DNA, areas unknown to
Darwin. Another growing area is comparative anatomy including homology and analogy.
Today we can see a bit of evolutionary history in the development of embryos, as certain
(although not all) aspects of development recapitulate evolutionary history.
9Biology - The Life Science
15
The molecular biology study of slowly mutating genes reveal considerable evolutionary
history consistent with fossil and anatomical record.
2.6 Challenges to Darwin
Figure 3
Darwin and his theories have been challenged many times in the last 150 years. The
challenges have been primarily religious based on a perceived conﬂict with the preconceived
notion of creationism. Many of those who challenge Darwin have been adherents to the
young earth hypothesis that says that the Earth is only some 6000 years old and that all
species were individually created by a god. Some of the proponents of these theories have
suggested that chemical and physical laws that exist today were diﬀerent or nonexistent in
earlier ages. However, for the most part, these theories are either not scientiﬁcally testable
and fall outside the area of attention of the ﬁeld of biology, or have been disproved by one
or more ﬁelds of science.

185 Life: History and Origin
5.1 Properties of life
1. Organization: Being structurally composed of one or more cells, which are the basic
units of life.
• prokaryote: no nucleus
• eukaryote: membrane bound nucleus.
2. Sensitivity: respond to stimuli.
3. Energy Processing
4. Growth and Development
5. Reproduction
• hereditary mechanisms to make more of self; DNA based.
6. Regulation, including homeostasis.
7. Evolution.
5.2 Origin of life: 3 hypotheses
• Extraterrestrial origin (panspermia): meteor, comet borne from elsewhere in universe
• evidence of amino acids and other organic material in space (but often both D & L
forms)
• questionable bacterial fossils in Martian rock
-However, this would imply that some other origin of life was likely because it would have
had to happen elsewhere before it could be transported here, and the only diﬀerence would
be that life did not originate on Earth.
• Spontaneous origin on earth: primitive self-replicating macromolecules acted upon by
natural selection ((macro)Evolution is one example of this)
-This is often attacked for the seeming impossibility for life to have been produced by a
chemical reaction triggered by lightning and the ability of any produced DNA to actually be
in a sequence that could produce a working model of life if replicated. It is also attacked
for religious reasons, as it bypasses things like the idea of a supreme being directly creating
humans. It also seems unlikely to some that such huge changes are possible in evolution
19Life: History and Origin
without evidence of an "in-between stage" that is credible. Many of the stages of man are
disputed due to their somewhat shakey grounds. For example, bones from other animals
have been taken accidentally in some cases to be part of a humanoid, and complete skeletons
have been sketched out from a limited number of bones.
• Special creation: religious explanations (Intelligent Design is one popular example of
this.) These explanations contend that life was created by God (or perhaps some other
Intelligent Designer).
• Proponents of Intelligent design suggest that the vast complexity of life could only
have been intentionally designed while other creationists cite biblical support.
-This is often attacked for many of the same reasons that religion is attacked, and is often
regarded as superstitious and/or unscientiﬁc.
• It is debated as to whether schools should teach one hypothesis or the other when talking
about the origin of life. However, since they are all currently known major hypotheses
(and sometimes hypotheses proven wrong are shown for educational purposes), this
wikibook includes what it can without discriminating unfairly against one hypothesis or
the other.
5.3 The early earth
It is believed that the Earth was formed about 4.5 billion years ago.
• Heavy bombardment by rubble ceased about 3.8 billion years ago.
• Reducing atmosphere: much free H
• also H O, NH , CH
2 3 4
• little, if any, free O
2
• with numerous H electrons, require little energy to form organic compounds with C
• Warm oceans, estimated at 49-88°C
• Lack of O and consequent ozone (O ) meant considerable UV energy
2 3
Chemical reactions on early earth
• UV and other energy sources would promote chemical reactions and formation of organic
molecules
• Testable hypothesis: Miller-Urey experiment
• simulated early atmospheric conditions
• found amino acids, sugars, etc., building blocks of life
• won Nobel prize for work
• experiment showed prebiotic synthesis of biological molecules was possible
Issues
• Miller later conceded that the conditions in his experiments were not representative of
what is currently thought to be those of early earth
• He also conceded that science has no answer for how amino acids could self-organize into
replicating molecules and cells
• In the 50 years since Miller-Urey, signiﬁcant issues and problems for biogenesis have been
identiﬁed. This is a weak hypothesis at this time.
20Origin of cells
• Conclusion: Life exists, we don't know why.
5.4 Origin of cells
Cells are very small and decompose quickly after death. As such, fossils of the earliest cells
do not exist. Scientists have had to form a variety of theories on how cells (and hence life)
was created on Earth.
• Bubble hypothesis
• A. Oparin, J.B.S. Haldane, 1930’s
• Primary abiogenesis: life as consequence of geochemical processes
• Protobionts: isolated collections of organic material enclosed in hydrophobic bubbles
• Numerous variants: microspheres, protocells, protobionts, micelles, liposomes, coacer-
vates
• Other surfaces for evolution of life
• deep sea thermal vents
• ice crystals
• clay surfaces
• tidal pools
5.5 The RNA world?
• DNA→ RNA→ polypeptide (protein)
• Catalytic RNA: ribozyme
• discovered independently by Tom Cech and Sid Altman (Nobel prize)
• catalytic properties: hydrolysis, polymerization, peptide bond formation, etc.
• Self-replicating RNA molecule may have given rise to life
• consistent with numerous roles for RNA in cells as well as roles for ribonucleotides
(ATP)
• relationship to bubble-like structures is uncertain
5.6 The earliest cells

237 Cell structure
7.1 What is a cell?
The word cell comes from the Latin word "cella", meaning "small room", and it was ﬁrst
coined by a microscopist observing the structure of cork. The cell is the basic unit of all
living things, and all organisms are composed of one or more cells. Cells are so basic and
critical to the study of life, in fact, that they are often referred to as "the building blocks of
life". Organisms - bacteria, amoebae and yeasts, for example - may consist of as few as one
cell, while a typical human body contains about a trillion cells.
According to Cell Theory, ﬁrst proposed by Schleiden and Schwann in 1839, all life consists
of cells. The theory also states that all cells come from previously living cells, all vital
functions (chemical reactions) of organisms are carried out inside of cells, and that cells
contain necessary hereditary information to carry out necessary functions and replicate
themselves.
All cells contain:
1
• Lipid bilayer boundary (plasma membrane )
2
• Cytoplasm
3
• DNA (hereditary information)
4
• Ribosomes for protein synthesis
Eukaryotic cells also contain:
5
• At least one nucleus
6
• Mitochondria for cell respiration and energy
Cells may also contain:
7
• Lysosomes
8
• Peroxisomes
9
• Vacuoles
10
• Cell walls

25Cell structure
7.1.1 Concepts
Plasma Membrane
Phospholipid bilayer, which contains great amount of proteins, the most important functions
are the following:
1. It selectively isolates the content of the cell of the external atmosphere.
2. It regulates the interchange of substances between the cytoplasm and the environment.
3. Communicates with other cells.
Model of the ﬂuid mosaic
Describes the structure of the plasma membrane, this model was developed in 1972 by
cellular biologists J. Singer and L. Nicholson.
Phospholipid bilayer
Is in the plasma membrane and produces the ﬂuid part of membranes.
Proteins
Long chains of amino acids.
Glucose proteins
Proteins together with carbohydrates in the plasma membrane, mostly in the outer parts
of the cell.
Functions of proteins
Transport oxygen, they are components of hair and nails, and allow the cell interact with
its environment.
Transport Proteins
Regulate the movement of soluble water molecules, through the plasma membrane. Some
transport proteins called channel proteins form pores or channels in the membrane so
that water soluble molecules pass.
Carrying proteins
Have union sites that can hold speciﬁc molecules.
Reception proteins
They activate cellular responses when speciﬁc molecules join.
Proteins of recognition
They work as identiﬁers and as place of union to the cellular surface.
Fluid
It is any substance that can move or change of form.
Concentration
Number of molecules in a determined unit of volume.
26What is a cell?
Gradient
Physical diﬀerence between two regions of space, in such a way that the molecules tend to
move in response to the gradients.
Diﬀusion
Movement of the molecules in a ﬂuid, from the regions of high concentration to those of
low concentration.
Passive transport
Movement of substances in a membrane that doesn’t need to use energy.
Simple diﬀusion
Diﬀusion of water, gases or molecules across the membrane.
Facilitated diﬀusion
Diﬀusion of molecules across the membranes with the participation of proteins.
Osmosis
Diﬀusion of the water across a membrane with diﬀerential permeability.
Transport that needs energy
Movement of substances across a membrane generally in opposition to a gradient of
concentration with the requirement of energy.
Active transport
Movement of small molecules using energy (ATP).
Endocytosis
Movement of big particles towards the interior of the cell using energy. The cells enclose
particles or liquids.
Pinocytosis
(Literally cell drinking) Form in which the cell introduces liquids.
Phagocytosis
Way of eating of the cells. It feeds in this case of big particles or entire microorganisms.
Pseudopods
False feet (the amoeba).
Exocitosis
Movement of materials out of the cell with the use of energy. It throws waste material.
Isotonic
The cytoplasm ﬂuid of the interior of the cells is the same that the outer.
Hypertonic solution
27Cell structure
The solutions that have a higher concentration of dissolved particles than the cellular
cytoplasm and that therefore water of the cells goes out with osmosis.
Hypotonic
The solutions with a concentration of dissolved particles lower than the cytoplasm of a cell
and that therefore do that water enters the cell with osmosis.
Swelling
Pressure of the water inside the vacuole.
Endoplasmic Reticulum
It is the place of the synthesis of the cellular membrane.
7.1.2 Structure and function of the cell
Rudolf Virchow
Zoologist, who proposed the postulates of the cellular theory, observes that the living cells
could grow and be in two places at the same time, he proposed that all the cells come from
other equal cells and proposed 3 postulates:
1. Every living organism is formed from one or more cells
2. The smallest organisms are unicellular and these in turn are the functional units of
the multicellular organisms.
3. All the cells come from preexisting cells.
7.1.3 Common characteristics of all the cells
Molecular components
Proteins, amino acids, lipids, sweeten, DNA, RNA.
Structural components
Plasmatic membrane, citoplasm, ribosomes.
Robert Hooke
He postuled for the ﬁrst time the term cell
Prokaryotes
Their genetic material is not enclosed in a membrane ex. Bacterias
Eukaryotes
Their genetic material is contained inside a nucleus closed by a membrane
28History of cell knowledge
7.2 History of cell knowledge
The optical microscope was ﬁrst invented in 17th century. Shortly thereafter scientists began
to examine living and dead biological tissues in order to better understand the science of
life. Some of the most relevant discovery milestones of the time period include:
11
• The invention of the microscope , which allowed scientists for the ﬁrst time to see
biological cells
12
• Robert Hooke in 1665 looked at cork under a microscope and described what he called
cork "cells"
13
• Anton van Leeuwenhoek called the single-celled organisms that he saw under the
microscope "animalcules"
14
• Matthias Jakob Schleiden , a botanist, in 1838 determined that all plants consist of
cells
15
• Theodor Schwann , a zoologist, in 1839 determined that all animals consist of cells
16
• Rudolf Virchow proposed the theory that all cells arise from previously existing cells
In 1838, the botanist Matthias Jakob Schleiden and the physiologist Theodor Schwann
discovered that both plant cells and animal cells had nuclei. Based on their observations,
the two scientists conceived of the hypothesis that all living things were composed of cells.
In 1839, Schwann published 'Microscopic Investigations on the Accordance in the Structure
and Growth of Plants and Animals', which contained the ﬁrst statement of their joint cell
theory.
7.2.1 Cell Theory
Schleiden and Schwann proposed spontaneous generation as the method for cell origination,
17
but spontaneous generation (also called abiogenesis ) was later disproven. Rudolf Virchow
famously stated "Omnis cellula e cellula"... "All cells only arise from pre-existing cells." The
parts of the theory that did not have to do with the origin of cells, however, held up to
scientiﬁc scrutiny and are widely agreed upon by the scientiﬁc community today.
The generally accepted portions of the modern Cell Theory are as follows: (1) The cell is the
fundamental unit of structure and function in living things. (2) All organisms are made up
of one or more cells. (3) Cells arise from other cells through cellular division. (4) Cells carry
genetic material passed to daughter cells during cellular division. (5) All cells are essentially
the same in chemical composition. (6) Energy ﬂow (metabolism and biochemistry) occurs
within cells.

7.3 Microscopes
• Allow greater resolution, can see ﬁner detail
• Eye: resolution of ˜ 100 μm
18
• Light microscope : resolution of ˜ 200 nm
• Limited to cells are larger organelles within cells
19
• Confocal microscopy : 2 dimension view
20
• Electron microscope : resolution of ˜0.2 nm
• Laser tweezers: move cell contents
7.4 Cell size
One may wonder why all cells are so small. If being able to store nutrients is beneﬁcial
to the cell, how come there are no animals existing in nature with huge cells? Physical
limitations prevent this from occurring. A cell must be able to diﬀuse gases and nutrients in
and out of the cell. A cell's surface area does not increase as quickly as its volume, and as a
result a large cell may require more input of a substance or output of a substance than it
is reasonably able to perform. Worse, the distance between two points within the cell can
be large enough that regions of the cell would have trouble communicating, and it takes a
relatively long time for substances to travel across the cell.
That is not to say large cells don't exist. They are, once again, less eﬃcient at exchanging
materials within themselves and with their environment, but they are still functional. These
cells typically have more than one copy of their genetic information, so they can manufacture
proteins locally within diﬀerent parts of the cell.
Key concepts: Cell size:
• Is limited by need for regions of cell to communicate
• Diﬀuse oxygen and other gases
21 22
• Transport of mRNA and protein s
• Surface area to volume ratio limited
• Larger cells typically:
• Have extra copies of genetic information
• Have slower communication between parts of cell

Eukaryotic cells feature membrane delimited nucleii containing two or more linear chromo-
2 3 4
some s; numerous membrane-bound cytoplasmic organelles: mitochondria, RER , SER ,
5 6 7
lysosomes, vacuole s, chloroplast s; ribosomes and a cytoskeleton . Also, plants, fungi, and
some protists have a cell wall.
8.1 Structure of the nucleus
The nucleus is the round object in the cell that holds the genetic information (DNA) of the
cell. It is surrounded by a nuclear envelope and has a nucleolus inside.
8.1.1 Nuclear envelope
8
The nuclear envelope is a double-layered plasma membrane like the cell membrane, although
without membrane proteins. To allow some chemicals to enter the nucleus, the nuclear
9
envelope has structures called Nuclear pore s. The nuclear envelope is continuous with the
endoplasmic reticulum.
8.1.2 Nucleolus
The nucleolus appears in a microscope as a small dark area within the nucleus. The nucleolus
10
is the area where there is a high amount of DNA transcription taking place.

11
Chromosomes consist of chromatin . This is made up of strings of DNA, which typically
12
measure centimeters in length if stretched out. This DNA is wound around a histone core
13
and organized into nucleosome s.
14 15 16
The chromatin must be uncoiled for gene expression and replication . Chromosome
micrograph
8.3 Endoplasmic reticulum
17 18
The endoplasmic reticulum is a cellular organelle made up of a series of extended folded
intracellular membranes. It is continuous with the nuclear membane.
There are two main types of endoplasmic reticulum:
19
• RER: rough endoplasmic reticulum (site of protein synthesis ) associated with ribosomes
20
• SER: smooth endoplasmic reticulum (site of lipid synthesis )
8.3.1 Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum
21
Proteins are directed to the RER by a signal sequence of a growing polypeptide s on
the ribosome. This is recognised by a signal recognition particle which brings the ribo-
some/polypeptide complex to a channel on the RER called a translocon. At the translocon,
the signal sequence and ribosome/polypeptide complex interact with the translocon to open
it. The signal sequence becomes attached to the translocon. The ribosome can continue to
translate the polypeptide into the lumen of the RER. As synthesis continues, 2 processes
can happen.
1. If the protein is destined to become a membrane bound protein then the protein
synthesis will continue until termination. The ribosome can then dissociate, allowing
protein folding within the RER lumen to occur and continuation to the golgi apparatus
for processing of the polypeptide.
2. Iftheproteinisdestinedforstorageforlatersecretionafterstimulationorforcontinuous
secretion then a protease-enzyme which cuts proteins at the peptide bond-can cut the
signal sequence from the growing polypeptide. Continuation to the golgi etc. can then
occur.

32Endoplasmic reticulum
When produced, proteins are then exported to one of several locations. The proteins are
either modiﬁed for extracellular membrane insertion or secretion. Note, this is in contrast
with ribosomes which do not associate with the RER and produce proteins which will become
cytosolic enzymes for example.
8.3.2 Smooth Endoplasmic Reticulum
22
Smooth endoplasmic reticulum produces enzyme s for lipid and carbohydrate biosynthesis
and detoxiﬁcation RER
8.3.3 Sarcoplasmic Reticulum
This is a specialised form of endoplasmic reticulum found in some muscle cell types-
particularly striated, skeletal muscle. Its main function is diﬀerent from the other 2 types in
that is mainly acts as a storage of calcium. This reticulum has voltage gated channels which
respond to signals from 'motor neurones' to open and release calcium into the cytoplasm.
This can then bring about the next part in muscle contraction.

8.4 The Golgi apparatus
24
The golgi apparatus is made up of multiple stacks of bilipid membranes.
• Proteins made on the RER are modiﬁed and then sorted
• Formation of secretory vesicles
• Formation of lysosomes (intracellular digestion)
Other membrane-bound cytoplasmic organelles include:
25
• Microbodies (generic term)
• Glyoxysome (transforms fat into carbohydrate in plants)
26
• Peroxisome (uses oxidative metabolism to form hydrogen peroxide and is destroyed by
27
catalase )
8.5 Ribosomes
Ribosomes are the site of protein synthesis. Ribosomes themselves are synthesized in the
28
cell nucleoli and are structured as two subunits, the large and the small. These parts are
composed of RNA and protein.
Prokaryotic and eukaryotic ribosomes are diﬀerent, the eukaryotic ones being larger and
more complicated.
8.6 DNA-containing organelles
Mitochondria
• Double membrane
• Aerobic metabolism, internal membrane

• Microtubule organizing centers
• Animal cells and many protists
• Pair constitutes the centrosome
• Give rise to ﬂagellum during spermatogenesis
• Consist of 9 triplet microtubules
31 32
• Mitosis , meiosis
8.7 Cytoskeleton
Cytoskeleton is a collective term for diﬀerent ﬁlaments of proteins that can give physical
shape within the cell and are responsible for the 'roads' which organelles can be carried
along.
• Gives the cell shape
• Anchors other organelles
• Vital to intracellular transport of large molecules
The cytoskeleton is composed of 3 main types of ﬁlaments:
33
• Actin ﬁlaments (7 nm)
34
• Microtubule s: (25 nm) polymer of tubulin; 13/ring.
35
• Intermediate Filament s
Both actin and microtubules can have associated motor proteins.
8.7.1 Intermediate Filaments
These are rope like ﬁlaments, 8-10nm in diameter and tend to give the structural stability to
cells. Examples inculude Vimentin, neuroﬁlaments and keratin. It is keratin which priniciply
makes up hair, nails and horns.
8.7.2 Actin Filaments
Growth
These ﬁlaments are 2-stranded and composed of dimeric subunits called G-Actin. They
contain a GTP molecule in order to bind (polymerise). As GTP is hydrolysed then the
structure becomes unstable and depolymerisation occurs. The growth of actin ﬁlaments is
concentration dependant-that is, the higher the concentration of free G-actin, the greater
the polymerisation. The are also polar, having a + and a - end (not related to charge) and
polymerisation tends to happen faster at the + end.

to move single celled organisms as well as move substances away from the surface of the cell.

2 3
acid molecules (mostly phospholipid s, lipids containing lots of phosphorus).

• The capacity to do work.
• Kinetic energy: energy of motion (ex. jogging).
• Potential energy: stored energy (ex. a lion that is about to leap on its prey).
• Many forms of energy: e.g.,
• Heat
• Sound
• Electric current
• Light
• All convertible to heat
• Most energy for biological world is from sun
• Heat (energy of random molecular motion, thermal energy)
• Convenient in biology
• All other energy forms can be converted to heat
• Thermodynamics: study of thermal energy
• Heat typically measured in kilocalories
• Kcal: 1000 calories
• 1 calorie: amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one gram of water one
degree Celsius (°C)
• Heat plays major role in biological systems
• Ecological importance
• Biochemical reactions
11.2 Oxidation–Reduction
• Energy ﬂows into biological world from sun
• Light energy is captured by photosynthesis
• Light energy raises electrons to higher energy levels
• Stored as potential energy in covalent C-H bonds of sugars
• Strength of covalent bond is measured by amount of energy required to break it
• 98.8 kcal/mole of C-H bonds
• In chemical reaction, energy stored in covalent bonds may transfer to new bonds. When
this involves transfer of electrons, it is oxidation–reduction reaction
• Always take place together
• Electron lost by atom or molecule through oxidation is gained by another atom or
molecule through reduction
• Potential energy is transferred from one molecule to another (but never 100%)
43Energy and Metabolism
• Often called redox reactions
• Photosynthesis
• Cellular Respiration
• Chemiosynthesis
• Autotrophs
• Heterotrophs
+
11.3 NAD
• Common electron acceptor/donor in redox reactions
+
• Energetic electrons often paired with H
11.4 Free energy
• Energy required to break and subsequently form other chemical bonds
• Chemical bonds: sharing of electrons, tend to hold atoms of molecule together
• Heat, by increasing atomic motion, makes it easier to break bonds (entropy)
• Energy available to do work in a system
• In cells, G = H - TS
• G = Gibbs’ free energy
• H = H (enthalpy) energy in molecule’s chemical bonds
• TS (T, temperature in °K; S, entropy)
• Chemical reactions break and make bonds, producing changes in energy
• Under constant conditions of temperature, pressure and volume,ΔG =ΔH - TΔS
• ΔG, change in free energy
• If positive (+), H is higher, S is lower, so there is more free energy; endergonic reaction,
does not proceed spontaneously; require input of energy (e.g., heat)
• If negative (–), H is lower, S is higher. Product has less free energy; exergonic;
spontaneous
===Activation energy = ==
• Reactions with –ΔG often require activation energy

molecule into the depleted molecule
• By iteration, pathway evolved backward

4913 Photosynthesis
6 CO + 6 H O→ C H O + 6 O
2 2 6 12 6 2
• One of most important reactions in history of life:
• source of atmospheric O
2
• ultimately led to aerobic respiration and eukaryotes
• Responsible for bulk of glucose production
• Early experiments showed that mass of plant must be derived from substances in the air,
not the soil
• Experiments with isotopes showed that liberated oxygen comes from water
• Experiments also showed that light is essential but that some reactions (e.g., reduction of
CO ) continue in the dark
2
• Plants do two big, important things during photosynthesis: gain energy (absorb light)
and build sugar (glucose).
• Photosynthesis can be divided into two series of chemical reactions: the light (light-
dependent) reactions and the dark (light-independent) reactions. In light reactions, light
is absorbed; in dark reactions, sugar is built.
• Occurs when plants, algae, and autotrophic bacteria absorb light energy and build glucose.
13.1 Light Reactions
• Part of the electromagnetic spectrum
• Consists of units of energy called photons
• Photons at UV end of spectrum have more energy than those at the red end
• Occur on the surface of thylakoid disks
• Chlorophyll and other plant pigments diﬀerentially absorb photons
• Chlorophyll a: light to chemical energy
• Chlorophyll b: accessory chlorophyll
• Chlorophylls absorb primarily blue and red (green reﬂected back, hence the green
color of plants)
13.1.1 Accessory pigments
• Chlorophyll is a major light gathering pigment
• Absorbs light with considerable eﬃciency (i.e., retaining energy)
• Accessory pigments
• Chlorophyll b
• Carotenoinds
• capture light of wavelengths not captured by chlorophylls
51Photosynthesis
• Confer other colors to plant leaves (autumn colors too)
Photosynthetic steps
• Primary photoevent: light photon captured by photosystem and energy transferred to
electron donated by water
• Electron transport: excited electron is shuttled along imbedded series of electron carriers
to proton pump and electron is transferred to acceptor
• Chemiosmosis: transport of protons back into chloroplast drives synthesis of ATP
13.1.2 The Even More Detailed Light Reactions
What the Light Reactions Do:
The light reactions of photosynthesis occur in chloroplasts in and on the thylakoid disks.
During the light reactions, light energy charges up ATP molecules. More speciﬁcally, light
turns the chloroplast into an acid battery, and this battery charges up ATP.
How the "Chloroplast-Battery" Charges ATP:
The stroma is the ﬂuid inside of the chloroplasts, and it carries a negative charge. This
means that it contains about a "gazillion" extra electrons. The solvent of stroma is water.
The ﬂuid inside the thylakoid disks is positively charged because it contains a lot of hydrogen
(H+) ions. The pH here is low, making the ﬂuid very acidic. The solvent of thylakoid disk
ﬂuid is water.
A chloroplast acts like a battery, because it has separated a strong positive charge and a
strong negative charge in two diﬀerent compartments. Energy is released when H+ ions
(free protons) ﬂow from the inside of a thylakoid disk to the stroma. This is electrical energy,
since it is a ﬂow of charged particles.
The protons pass through special channels (made of protein) in the thylakoid membrane;
this reaction is 'exothermic.' The energy that is given oﬀ is used to fuel this reaction (Pi is
the phosphate ion):
ADP + Pi --> ATP
The proton can go to the negative stroma, but only if it uses its energy to charge up ATP.
Since one reaction wants to go, and the other one doesn't, and since the ﬁrst reaction releases
energy and the second one absorbs energy, the two reactions are known to be 'coupled'
together so that the ﬁrst fuels the second. Of course, a special enzyme must be involved for
this to happen.
Chlorophyll Molecules on a Thylakoid Disk:
Hundreds of chlorophyll molecules cover the surface of a thylakoid disk, making the disk
green. The nonpolar "tails" of the chlorophyll molecule are embedded in the membrane of
the thylakoid.
52“Dark” reactions
13.2 “Dark” reactions
• ATP drives endergonic reactions
• NADPH provides hydrogens for reduction of CO to carbohydrate (C-H bonds)
2
• Occur in the stroma
• First step in carbon ﬁxation
13.2.1 The Detailed Dark Reactions
What the Dark Reactions Do:
The dark reactions build sugar from carbon dioxide gas (CO2), water (H2O), and energy
from ATP molecules that were charged up during the light reactions. The dark reactions
occur in the stroma of a chloroplast. Dark reactions usually occur in the light, but they
don't have to. They'll occur in the dark until the chloroplast's supply of ATP runs out
(usually about 30 seconds).
The Calvin Cycle:
The Calvin Cycle is the fancy name for the metabolic pathway that builds sugar. This
means that it involves a whole lot of chemical reactions, and it uses a lot of diﬀerent enzymes
to catalyze the reactions.
Carbon dioxide gas is stable, therefore the bonds that hold the carbon and oxygen atoms
are strong. Therefore it takes a lot of energy to break the bonds and separate the carbon
atoms from the oxygen atoms. The energy needed to do this comes from ATP molecules.
When inorganic carbon (like from CO2) is being added to an organic molecule (such as
sugar), this is called carbon ﬁxation.
It takes 2 complete turns of the Calvin Cycle to make a glucose molecule.

template for synthesis of its complement.
• Genetic evidence showed that the bacterial chromosome is circular long before there was
corroborating physical evidence.
Eukaryotic chromosomes
• Discovered by Walther Fleming in 1882 in dividing cells of salamander larvae, following
improvements in microscopes and staining technology
• He called division mitosis (mitos = “thread”)
• Chromosome number is constant in a species
• Ranges from 2 to >500 (46 in human somatic cells)
• Homologous pairs, one contributed by each parent
• Change in number is cause and consequence of speciation
• Chromosome constancy and their precise division in mitosis and meiosis led biologists to
postulate that they were carriers of hereditary information
13.5 Chromosome number
• 1N = number of chromosomes in gamete
• 1N = haploid chromosome number
• 2N = number of chromosomes in somatic cells (cells that are not egg or sperm)

13.15 Controlling the cell cycle
• External signals initiate cell division in multicellular organisms
• Growth factors: extracellular regulatory signals
• Usually soluble; bind to cell surface receptor

6115 Genetics
6316 Gregor Mendel and biological
inheritance
1
Charles Darwin , for all he contributed to the science of biology, never knew about the
mechanism by which living things inherit traits from previous generations, or how new traits
arise.
As any schoolchild can tell you, this mechanism of interitance has since been found to be
2
DNA , or deoxyribonucleic acid. DNA allows for stable inheritance of traits: the code in
each strand of DNA is replicated precisely through the pairing of basic units along each
strand. The error rate in this replication is amazingly low; not even one base pair in a
million matches out of sequence.
However, when even one base pair is added to a new strain of DNA in an order diﬀerently
than in the parent chain, it can be the basis of amutation. These changes in DNA sequences
are the microscopic origin of changes in traits of all studied living things. Even the smallest
diﬀerence in a strand of DNA can result in a change in traits that can cost the life of the
organism. Mutations can produce proteins with a new or altered function. In humans, the
3
example of Sickle cell anemia is commonly given as its origin is a diﬀerence of only one
base pair in a section of DNA that encodes red blood cells.
Individual sequences of DNA that encode for speciﬁc proteins are called genes and are the
4
units of heredity. Each one has a set nucleotide , and together all of the genes (and some
sequence of DNA that apparently do not code for any biologically important functions)
5
together make up the entire chromosome
16.1 Mendel
• Discovered principle of genetic segregation via numerous experiments utilizing pea plants
• Inferred the existence of genes through segregation of phenotypes
• Used quantitative methods: counted; ratios
• Work is model of scientiﬁc method
• In particular, observed the F2 progeny, which lead to the discovery of dominant and
recessive traits
• Published work in 1866, went unnoticed
• In 1900 his scientiﬁc paper was “rediscovered”

4 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nucleotide
5 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chromosome
65Gregor Mendel and biological inheritance
• Mendel is acknowledged as founder of Genetics
• still used alphabet letters to designate genes
• still refer to dominant and recessive genes
• still refer to segregation of alleles in meiosis
• principle of segregation applies to all sexually reproducing organisms; Mendel’s results
were immediately applied to humans in 1900
16.2 Mendel’s experiments
• 1856, began experiments with the garden pea, Pisum sativum
• 1865, presented results to the Bruno natural history society, which he helped found
• 1866, published his results in proceedings of the society
• Naegeli encouraged Mendel to reproduce results in another species, which failed because
the species did not undergo true fertilization
• discrete traits in Pisum sativum
• pure-breeding lines
• dominant/recessive alleles
• alleles are two alternate versions of a gene
• gametes contain hybridized chromosomes that are formed during meiosis
• homozygous has two of the same allele
• heterozygous has two diﬀerent alleles
• reciprocal F1 crosses (all exhibiting dominant phenotypes); F2; F3
• counted oﬀspring, noted ratios
• inferred genotypes from phenotypes
• tested hypotheses with testcrosses
• attempted to repeat with another species
16.3 Mendel’s seven pairs of traits
1. Seed form (round or wrinkled)
2. Cotyledon color (green or yellow)
3. Seed coat color (white or colored)
4. Pod form (inﬂated or constricted)
5. Pod color (green or yellow)
6. Flower position (axial or terminal)
7. Plant heights (tall or short)
16.4 Locus
• The location of a speciﬁc gene within a chromosome
66Modern Y chromosome
16.5 Modern Y chromosome
Y-chromosome is the most evolved chromosome. Generally it is thought that if Y- chro-
mosome is present in an individual then he will be male. But if mutation occurs at sex
determining region or zinc factor then it will not code for testis determining factor, and
results in normal female. This type of female's frequency is 1/250000.
16.6 Chromosome phenomena
• X-chromosome inactivation
• Barr bodies
• Nondisjunction: failure of chromosome segregation at meiosis or mitosis
• Results in 2N± 1 chromosome number
• Trisomy 2N + 1
• Usually lethal. Trisomy 21 (Down) exception
• Monosomy 2N ** 1
• Lethal except XO
• Usually maternal origin in humans
16.7 X-chromosome inactivation
In females, one X-chromosone is randomly switched oﬀ forming a Barr body.
16.8 Barr body
Dense region in the nucleus formed by the inactive X-chromosome.
16.9 Human genetic disorders
Down's Syndrome(Mongolism)
Down's Syndrome is usually produced by the nondisjunction of chromosome 21 during
oogenesis and sometimes during spermatogenesis. The individual suﬀering from this type of
syndrome has 47 chromosomes instead of the normal 46. The extra chromosome is not a sex
chromosome but an autosome.
Most cases of mongolism were found to occur in children born by women in their forties.
The aﬀected children, called mongoloids, show mental retardation and have a shorter life
expectancy. Their most prominent feature is the Mongolian folds in their eyes; hence, the
term mongolism.
Klinefelter's Syndrome
67Gregor Mendel and biological inheritance
When an XY-bearing sperm unites with an X-bearing egg, the resulting condition is called
Klinefelter's Syndrome, or sexually undeveloped male. Individuals having the syndrome
show the following characteristics:
• testes are small
• sperms are never produced
• breasts are enlarged
• body hair is sparse
• individuals are mentally defective
The same abnormal meiotic division may occur in females. They produce eggs with XX or
no sex chromosomes. Such egg, when fertilized by a Y-bearing sperm, will not develop (YO).
This is because YO is lethal--it wil cause death to the oﬀspring.
6817 DNA: The Genetic Material
17.1 DNA
DNA stands for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid. That is, a nucleic acid with two sugars. DNA is
the hereditary material of cells and is considered the blueprint of life. DNA is found in all
kingdoms of life. Even most viruses have DNA. A molecule of DNA is chemically stable (it
does not have a 2-prime alcohol group.)
When someone says DNA, they may be referring to one's genetic material on multiple levels:
They may be speaking about a single deoxyribose nucleic acid molecule, a section of a double
helix, a section of a chromosome, or one's entire hereditary composition.
• antiparallel
• Double helix
• Semiconservative replication
• Sequence of nucleotides encodes functional RNA or polypeptide
17.2 Historical perspective
• Mitosis and meiosis
• Regular distribution of chromosomes suggested that they contain hereditary informa-
tion
• Bridges/Morgan, usingDrosophilamelanogastershowedthatgenesareonchromosomes
(1910s)
• Hammerling: nucleus contains hereditary information (1930s)
• Griﬃth: transformation of bacteria (1928)
• Avery, MacLeod, McCarty: transforming substance is DNA (1944)
• Hershey, Chase: DNA is hereditary material of viruses (1952)
• Rosalind Franklin
• Watson and Crick: structure of DNA (1953)
17.3 Hershey-Chase Experiment
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading suggestions that DNA was a
genetic material. Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA
into a bacterium. They did two experiments marking either the DNA in the phage with
a radioactive phophorus or the protein of the phage with radioactive sulfur. With the
bacteria that was infected by the phages with radioactive DNA the DNA in the bacteria
69DNA: The Genetic Material
was radioactive. In the bacteria that was infected with the radioactive protein the bacteria
was radioactive, not the DNA. This proves that DNA is a genetic material and it is passed
on in viruses.
17.4 DNA/RNA components
• Miescher: discovered DNA, 1869
17.4.1 Structure of DNA
DNA is in a double helix structure made up of nucleotides. The "backbone" of the double
helix is composed of phosphates connected to a ﬁve carbon sugar called deoxyribose, . The
"rungs" are composed of nitrogenous bases, Purines and Pyrimidines. Purines contain
Adenine(A) and Guanine(G) and have two rings in their structures. Pyrimidines contain
Cytosine(C) and Thymine (T) and have one ring in their structures.

8020 Mutation
1
A mutation is a permanent change to an organism's genetic material (DNA or RNA).
Mutations are a rare but signiﬁcant biological process, since they provide the variation on
2
which evolution acts and are also the source of cancer.
3
An organism's genetic material is made up of polymers (chains) of four diﬀerent nucleotides ,
like a recipe book written in a language of only four letters. A mutation event is when the
order of the nucleotides in DNA change, usually when the DNA is being copied.
Mutations come in a number of forms:
20.1 Point Mutations
Point mutations are all mutations which involve a single nucleotide. These come in the form
of substitutions, insertions and deletions:
20.2 Substitution
Substitution Mutations: In substitution mutations, a nitrogenous base of a triplet codon of
DNA is replaced by another nitrogen base or some derivative of the nitrogen base, changing
the codon. The altered codon codes for a diﬀerent amino acid substitution.The substitution
mutations are of two types:
1.Transitions: It is the replacement of one purine in a polynucleotide chain by another
purine(A by G or C by A) or one pyrimidine by another pyrimidine(T by C or C by T)
2.Transversions:A base pair substitution involving the substitution of a purine by pyrimidine
or pyrimidine by a purine is called transversion.

20.3.2 Rearrangement
20.3.3 Gene/Exon Duplications

20.4 Chromosomal mutations
Chromosomal mutations involve changes to entire chromosomes. These mutations are
particularly rare:
20.4.1 Translocation
20.4.2 Fusion
20.4.3 Fission
20.4.4 Segmental Duplication
20.4.5 Chromosomal Duplication
20.4.6 Genome Duplication
20.5 Causes of mutations
20.6 Eﬀects of mutations
Mutations can have a variety of diﬀerent eﬀects depending on the type of mutation, the
signiﬁcance of the piece of genetic material aﬀected and whether the cells aﬀected are germ-
82Further reading
line cells. Only mutations in germ-line cells can be passed on to children, while mutations
elsewhere can cause cell-death or cancer.
Mutations can be classiﬁed by their eﬀects:
20.6.1 Silent Mutation
Silent Mutations are DNA mutations that do not result in a change to the amino acid
sequence or a protein. They may occur in a non-coding region (outside of a gene or within
an intron), or they may occur within an exon in a manner that does not alter the ﬁnal
amino acid chain.
20.6.2 Frameshift
20.6.3 Missense Mutation
Missense mutations are types of point mutations where a single nucleotide is changed to
cause substitution of a diﬀerent amino acid. This in turn can render the resulting protein
nonfunctional. Such mutations are responsible for diseases such as Epidermolysis bullosa.

9122 Classiﬁcation of Living Things
22.0.1 Classiﬁcation of Living Things & Naming
With so many ﬂora and fauna on planet Earth, there must be a method to classify each
organism to distinguish it from others so it can be correctly identiﬁed. Classiﬁcation does
not only apply to biology. For example, supermarkets and grocery stores organise their
products by classifying them. Beverages may occupy one aisle, while cleaning supplies may
occupy another. In science, the practice of classifying organisms is called taxonomy (Taxis
means arrangement and nomos means law). The modern taxonomic system was developed
by the Swedish botanist Carolus (Carl) Linneaeus (1707-1788). He used simple physical
characteristics of organisms to identify and diﬀerentiate between diﬀerent species.
Linneaeus developed a hierarchy of groups for taxonomy. To distinguish diﬀerent levels of
similarity, each classifying group, called taxon (pl. taxa) is subdivided into other groups.
To remember the order, it is helpful to use a mnemonic device. The taxa in hierarchical
order:
• Domain - Archea, Eubacteria, Eukaryote
• Kingdom - Plants, Animals, Fungi, Protists, Eubacteria (Monera), Archaebacteria
• Phylum
• Class
• Order
• Family
• Genus
• Species
The domain is the broadest category, while species is the most speciﬁc category available.
The taxon Domain was only introduced in 1990 by Carl Woese, as scientists reorganise
things based on new discoveries and information. For example, the European Hare would
be classiﬁed as follows:
Eukaryote --> Animal --> Chordata --> Mammalia --> Lagomorpha --> Leporidae -->
Lepus --> Lepus europaeus.
Binomial nomenclature is used to name an organism, where the ﬁrst word beginning
with a capital is the genus of the organism and the second word beginning with lower-case
letter is the species of the organism. The name must be in italics and in Latin, which was
the major language of arts and sciences in the 18th century. The scientiﬁc name can be also
abbreviated, where the genus is shortened to only its ﬁrst letter followed by a period. In our
example, Lepus europaeus would become L. europaeus'.
Taxonomy and binomial nomenclature are both speciﬁc methods of classifying an organism.
They help to eliminate problems, such as mistaken identity and false assumptions, caused
by common names. An example of the former is the fact that a North American robin is
93Classiﬁcation of Living Things
quite diﬀerent from the English robin. An example of the latter is the comparison between
crayﬁsh and catﬁsh, where one might believe that they both are ﬁsh when in fact, they are
quite diﬀerent.
Nomenclature is concerned with the assignment of names to taxonomic groups in agreement
with published rules.
22.0.2 Eukaryotes & Prokaryotes
Recall that there are two basic types of cells: eukaryotes and prokaryotes.
Eukaryotes are more complex in structure, with nuclei and membrane-bound organelles.
Some characteristics of eukaryotes are:
• Large (100 - 1000 μm)
• DNA in nucleus, bounded by membrane
• Genome consists of several chromosomes.
• Sexual reproduction common, by mitosis and meiosis
• Mitochondria and other organelles present
• Most forms are multicellular
• Aerobic
Prokaryotes refer to the smallest and simplest type of cells, without a true nucleus and no
membrane-bound organelles. Bacteria fall under this category. Some characteristics:
• Small (1-10 μm)
• DNA circular, unbounded
• Genome consists of single chromosome.
• Asexual reproduction common, not by mitosis or meiosis.
• No general organelles
• Most forms are singular
• Anaerobic
22.0.3 The Three Domains
The three domains are organised based on the diﬀerence between eukaryotes and prokaryotes.
Today's living prokaryotes are extremely diverse and diﬀerent from eukaryotes. This fact has
been proven by molecular biological studies (e.g. of RNA structure) with modern technology.
The three domains are as follows:
Archea (Archeabacteria) consists of archeabacteria, bacteria which live in extreme
environments. The kingdom Archaea belongs to this domain.
Eubacteriaconsistsofmoretypicalbacteriafoundineverydaylife. ThekingdomEubacteria
belongs to this domain.
Eukaryote encompasses most of the world's visible living things. The kingdoms Protista,
Fungi, Plantae, and Animalia fall under this category.
94Stem cells
22.0.4 The Six Kingdoms
Under the three domains are six kingdoms in taxonomy. The ﬁrst two, Plants andAnimals,
are commonly understood and will not be expounded here.
Protista, the third kingdom, was introduced by the German biologist Ernst Haeckel in
1866 to classify micro-organisms which are neither animals nor plants. Since protists are
quite irregular, this kingdom is the least understood and the genetic similarities between
organisms in this kingdom are largely unknown. For example, some protists can exhibit
properties of both animals and plants.
Fungi are organisms which obtain food by absorbing materials in their bodies. Mushrooms
and moulds belong in this kingdom. Originally, they were part of the plant kingdom but
were recategorised when they were discovered not to photosynthesise.
Eubacteria are bacteria, made up of small cells, which diﬀer in appearance from the
organisms in the above kingdoms. They lack a nucleus and cell organelles. They have cell
walls made of peptidoglycan.
Archae (or Archaebacteria) are bacteria which live in extreme environments, such as
salt lakes or hot, acidic springs. These bacteria are in their own category as detailed studies
have shown that they have unique properties and features (ex. unusual lipids that are not
found in any other organism)which diﬀer them from other bacteria and which allow them to
live where they live. Their cell walls lack peptidoglycan.
22.0.5 Origins of Diversity
The diversity in our planet is attributed to diversity within a species. As the world changed
in climate and in geography as time passed, the characteristics of species diverged so much
that new species were formed. This process, by which new species evolve, was ﬁrst described
by British naturalist Charles Darwin as natural selection.
For an organism to change, genetic mutations must occur. At times, genetic mutations are
accidental, as in the case of prokaryotes when they undergo asexual reproduction. For most
eukaryotes, genetic mutations occur through sexual reproduction, where meiosis produces
haploid gametes from the original parent cells. The fusion of these haploid gametes into
a diploid zygote results in genetic variation in each generation. Over time, with enough
arrangement of genes and traits, new species are produced. Sexual reproduction creates an
immense potential of genetic variety.
One goal of taxonomy is to determine the evolutionary history of organisms. This can be
achieved by comparing species living today with species in the past. The comparison in
anatomy and structure is based on data from development, physical anatomy, biochemistry,
DNA, behaviour, and ecological preferences. The following are examples of how such data is
used:
• Anatomy:
Although a horse and a human may look diﬀerent, there is evidence that their arm structures
are quite similar. Their arms' sizes and proportions may be diﬀerent, but the anatomical
structures are quite similar. Such evidence reveals that animals in diﬀerent taxa may not
95Classiﬁcation of Living Things
be that diﬀerent. Biological features from a common evolutionary origin are known as
homologous.
• Development
• Biochemistry:
Biochemical analysis of animals similar in appearance have yielded surprising results. For
example, although guinea pigs were once considered to be rodents, like mice, biochemistry
led them to be in their taxon of their own.
22.0.6 Phylogeny, Cladistics & Cladogram
Modern taxonomy is based on many hypotheses' of the evolutionary history of organisms,
known as phylogeny. As with the Scientiﬁc Method, scientists develop a hypothesis on the
history of an animal and utilise modern science and technology to prove the phylogeny.
Cladistics is a classiﬁcation system which is based on phylogeny. Expanding on phylogeny,
cladistics is based on the assumption that each group of related species has one common
ancestor and would therefore retain some ancestral characteristics. Moreover, as these
related species evolve and diverge from their common ancestor, they would develop unique
characteristics. Such characteristics are known as derived characteristics
The principles of phylogeny and cladistics can be expressed visually as a cladogram,
a branching diagram which acts as a family (phylogenetic) tree for similar species. A
cladogram can also be used to test alternative hypotheses for an animal's phylogeny. In
order to determine the most likely cladogram, the derived characteristics of similar species
are matched and analysed.

22.1 Introduction
Viruses are the smallest biological particle (the tiniest are only 20 nm in diameter). However,
they are not biological organisms so they are not classiﬁed in any kingdom of living things.
They do not have any organelles and cannot respire or perform metabolic functions. Viruses
are merely strands of DNA or RNA surrounded by a protective protein coat called a capsid.
Viruses only come to life when they have invaded a cell. Outside of a host cell, viruses are
completely inert.
Since ﬁrst being identiﬁed in 1935, viruses have been classiﬁed into more than 160 major
groups. Viruses are classiﬁed based on their shape, replication properties, and the diseases
that they cause. Furthermore, the shape of a virus is determined by the type and arrangement
of proteins in its capsid. Viruses pathogenic to humans are currently classiﬁed into 21 groups.
Viruses can also attack bacteria and infect bacterial cells. Such viruses are called bacterio-
phages.
97Classiﬁcation of Living Things
22.2 Viral Replication
As previously stated, viruses are not a biological life form so they cannot reproduce by
themselves. They need to take over a functioning eukaryotic or prokaryotic cell to replicate
its DNA or RNA and to make protein coat for new virus particles.
In order to enter a cell, a virus must attach to a speciﬁc receptor site on the plasma membrane
of the host cell. The proteins on the surface of the virus act as keys which ﬁt exactly into a
matching glycoprotein on the host cell membrane. In some viruses, the attachment protein
is not on the surface of the virus but is in the capsid or in the envelope.
There are two forms of viral replication: the lytic cycle and the lysogenic cycle.
22.2.1 Lytic Cycle
1. Attachment: The virus binds to speciﬁc receptors on the host cell.
2. Entry: There are two ways in which a virus can enter cells. Firstly, the virus can inject
its nucleic acid into the host cell. Secondly, if a virus is contained in an envelope, the
host cell can phagocytosise the entire virus particle into a vacuole. When the virus
breaks out of the vacuole, it then releases its nucleic acid into the cell.
3. Replication: The virus's nucleic acid instructs the host cell to replicate the virus's
DNA or RNA.
4. Assembly: New virus particles are assembled.
5. Lysis and Release: The virus directs the production of an enzyme which damages
the host cell wall, causing the host cell to swell and burst. The newly formed virus
particles are now released.
22.2.2 Lysogenic Cycle
1. Attachment: Similar to Lytic Cycle
2. Entry: Similar to Lytic Cycle
3. Incorporation: The viral nucleic acids is not replicated, but instead integrated by
genetic combination (crossing over) into the host cell's chromosome. When integrated
in a host cell this way, the viral nucleic acid as part of the host cell's chromosome is
known as a prophage.
4. Host Cell Reproduction: The host cell reproduces normally. Subsequent cell divisions,
daughter cells, contain original father cell's chromosome embedded with a prophage.
5. Cycle Induction: Certain factors now determine whether the daughter cell undergoes
the lytic or lysogenic cycle. At any time, a cell undergoing the lysogenic cycle can
switch to the lytic cycle.
The reproduction cycle of viruses with RNA and no DNA is slightly diﬀerent. A notable
example of a RNA-based virus is HIV, a retrovirus.
98Viral Genome
Retrovirus reproductive cycle
1. The retrovirus force RNA into cell, by either one of the two methods of entry (See
above).
2. In the retrovirus are reverse transcriptase enzymes, which catalyses the synthesis of a
DNA strand complementary to the viral RNA.
3. Reverse transcriptase catalyses a second DNA strand complementary to the ﬁrst. With
these two strands, the double-stranded DNA can be created.
4. DNA is then incorporated into the host cell's chromosomes. Similar to the concept of
a prophage, this incorporated DNA is called a provirus. However, the provirus never
leaves the host cell, unlike a prophage.
5. The infected host cell undergoes the lytic or lysogenic cycle.
22.3 Viral Genome
The genome of a virus consists of DNA or RNA, whose size and conﬁguration vary. The
entire genome can exist as a single nucleic acid molecule or several nucleic acid segments.
Also, the DNA or RNA may be single-stranded or double-stranded, and either linear or
circular.
Not all viruses can reproduce in a host cell by themselves. Since viruses are so small, the
size of their genome is limiting. For example, some viruses have coded instructions for only
making a few diﬀerent proteins for the viruses' capsid. On the other hand, the human
genome codes for over 30,000 diﬀerent proteins. Therefore, the lack of coded instructions
cause some viruses to need the presence of other viruses to help them reproduce themselves.
Such viruses are called replication defective.
Lastly, it is worthy to note that 70% of all viruses are RNA viruses. As the process of RNA
replication (with enzymes and other organelles of the host cell) is more prone to errors, RNA
viruses have much higher mutation rates than do DNA viruses.
22.4 Viruses Practice Questions
1. As the name implies, the Tomato Spotted Wilt Virus targets tomatoes. Would it be
possible for this virus to target other fruits as well? Explain.
2. If a DNA and a RNA virus both infected somatic cells, which virus would be more
diﬃcult to detect?
3. Many people have had cold sores, which are caused by infection with the herpes
simplex virus. One characteristic of cold sores is that after a period of inactivity, they
will reappear many times during the course of a person's life. Which cycle would the
herpes simplex virus undergo?
4. Chicken pox is a common, non-fatal disease usually acquired in adolescence and caused
by the varicella zoster virus. In adulthood, many people suﬀer from shingles, an altered
form of the varicella zoster virus. Which cycle would the varicella zoster virus have
undergone?
5. Would an antibiotic work for a person suﬀering from a cold of ﬂu? Explain.

100Domains of life: characteristics
22.7 Domains of life: characteristics
This text is based on notes very generously donated by Paul Doerder, Ph.D., of the Cleveland
State University.
22.8 Introduction
Out of the six kingdoms, Protista is the most diverse. This is the kingdom of organisms
with strange, atypical characteristics. In essence, this kingdom is designated for organisms
which do not belong in any other kingdom. The majority of protists are microscopic.
22.9 Classiﬁcation of Protists
There are three phyla of protists, based on their type of nutrition.
1. Protozoa (animal-like protists) are heterotrophs that ingest or absorb their food.
2. Algae (plant-like protists) are autotrophs they get nutrition from photosythesis.
3. Slime moulds and water moulds (fungus-like protists) are also heterotrophs, like
protozoa.
22.10 Protozoa
As heterotrophs, protozoa scavenge materials from their surroundings. Others are predators
which actively hunt or ambush small organisms such as bacteria and other protozoa for a
source of nutrition. Protozoa can be parasitic as well; they may live inside larger organisms,
like humans. Most protozoa live as single cells, although a few form colonies.
Protozoa are generally diﬃcult to identify due to their varied shape. They may appear as
jelly-like blobs, spherical sunbursts, or a ﬂattened leaf. Tiny blood parasites may be only 2
μm long. On the other hand, shell-covered marine may be 5 cm or more in diameter.
Furthermore, diﬀerent protozoans have their own complex life cycles. The complexity has
led certain organisms to be mistakenly classiﬁed for other species.
Nevertheless, protozoa can move, and so, they are classiﬁed based on their methods of
locomotion.
Characteristics of Protozoa :
• About 30,000 species known
• About 10,000 species are pathogenic, including some of the worst human diseases
• heterotrophic
• highly variable in form and life cycle
101Classiﬁcation of Living Things
• mostly unicellular
• range in size from 0.005 mm to 50 mm
• lack cell walls
they love environment and each other..............
22.11 Algae
Algae are much simpler than protozoa. They are aquatic and contain chlorophyll. Algae can
exist as a single cell or as giant seaweeds 60 m in length. Formerly, algae were classiﬁed as
plants but this was incorrect as algae lack parts of true plants: leaves, stems, roots, xylem,
and phloem. Since algae belong in the kingdom Protista, algae is a broad term used to
denote all aquatic eukaryotes which photosynthesise; algae can diﬀer in size and shape as
well.
There are six phyla of algae:chlorophytes (green algae), phaeophytes (brown algae),
rhodophytes (red algae), chrysophytes (diatoms), pyrrophytes (dinoﬂagellates),
and euglenophytes (euglenoids).
22.11.1 Chlorophytes
Chlorophytes resemble plants the most. Like plants, their cell walls contain cellulose and
they store food in reserve as starch. Chlorophytes can be unicellular or multicellular. Most
chlorophytes use ﬂagellae for some locomotion.
22.11.2 Phaeophytes
Phaeophytes are nearly all multicellular marine organisms, which are known to us as seaweeds.
They have cell walls composed of cellulose and alginic acid (a substance similar to pectin).
The cellulose and alignic acid help to retain water and prevent seawood from drying out
when exposed to air at low tide.
Since phaeophytes live in a tidal environment, they have large, ﬂat fronds (a large leaf)
which can withstand pounding by waves. Their bases strongly anchor the algae to the rocky
seabed and prevent them from being washed out to sea. Phaeophytes are usually found in
areas of cold water.
22.11.3 Rhodophytes
Rhodophytes are typically found in warmer seawater, and are more delicate and smaller
than brown algae (phaeophytes). Rhodophytes are also able to grow at deeper depths in
the ocean, since red algae absorb green, violet, and blue light, the wavelengths of which
penetrate the deepest below the water surface. They also have mucilaginous material to
resist drying.
102Slime molds & Water molds
22.11.4 Chryosophytes
Chryosophytes are the most abundant unicellular algae in the oceans. They are also one
of the biggest components of plankton, a free-ﬂoating collection of microorganisms, eggs,
and larvae. As photosynthetic organisms, they produce a signiﬁcant amount of atmospheric
oxygen.
The reproduction cycle of chryosophytes is particularly interesting. Note that diatoms
reproduce both asexually and sexually. Since diatoms have a rigid cell wall with an outer
layer of silica (found in sand and glass), the daughter cells produced by mitosis must ﬁt
inside the original cell wall. Therefore, each generation of diatoms is smaller than the one
before. The reduction in size continues until the diatoms produce sexually, producing a
zygote which eventually grows to the original size as it matures.
22.11.5 Pyrrophytes
Pyrrophytes are unicellular, photosynthetic, and mostly aquatic. They have protective coats
composed of stiﬀ cellulose. They are more easily identiﬁable, due to the presence of two
ﬂagellae. The longer ﬂagellae propels the dinoﬂagellate, while the second shorter, ﬂatter
ﬂagellae functions as a rudder.
Some species of pyrrophytes are zooxanthellae. Since they lack cellulose plates, they make
their home in coral reefs and animals, such as sea anemones, and molluscs. In returning
the favour of sheltering them, dinoﬂagellates provide carbohydrates to their host through
photosynthesis. This is why there are nutrient-rich coral reefs in malnutritions water.
A negative aspect of pyrrophytes is that under certain conditions, species of dinoﬂagellates
reproduce rapidly to form a harmful algal bloom (HAB), known as a red tide if dinoﬂag-
ellates are the cause. Such pyrrophytes can produce toxins which may injure or kill wildlife,
and additionally any consumers of contaminated wildlife.
22.11.6 Euglenophytes
Like pyrrophytes, euglenophytes are small unicellular freshwater organisms with two ﬂagella.
They are mainly autotrophic or heterotrophic, depending if they have a red, light-sensitive
structure called an eyespot.
22.12 Slime molds & Water molds
There are two phyla of slime moulds and one phylum of water moulds.
22.12.1 Oomycotes (Water moulds)
Oomycotes are ﬁlamentous organisms which resemble fungi, in that they live as saprotrophs.
Oomycotes diﬀer from other moulds with the presence of spores and their sexual life cycle.
103Classiﬁcation of Living Things
22.12.2 Myxomycotes (Plasmodial slime moulds)
Myxomycotiesarevisibletothenakedeyeastinyslug-likeorganismswhichcreepoverdecayed
and dead matter. This streaming blob containing many nuclei is called a plasmodium.
22.12.3 Acrasiomycotes (Cellular slime moulds) and its reproductive
cycle
Acrasiomycotes exist as individual amoeboid cells with one nucleus each. When in un-
favourable conditions, each acrasiomycete cell gathers together to form a pseudoplasmod-
ium.
Reproductive Cycle:
1. One acrasiomycete cell joins with others to form a pseudoplasmodium.
2. The pseudoplasmodium shrinks and forms a smaller plasmodium.
3. The plasmodium migrates to a suitable environment.
4. The plasmodium develops a sporangia, where original parental nuclei has divided by
meiosis into haploid spores to be germinated.
5. When favourable conditions arise, the spores germinate and are carried away by animals
or the wind.
6. Cycle repeats.

23.23 Introduction
Although you may not recognise fungi, they are just as prevalent as plants and animals.
Their spores are in the air which we breathe, fungi allow us to make bread, and mushrooms
(a type of fungi) are eaten by us. A few types of fungi are unicellular. For example, yeasts live
as individual oval or cylindrical cells. However, the majority of fungi live are multicellular.
Their bodies are composed of hyphae, a network of ﬁne ﬁlaments. In a mushroom, the
111Multicellular Photosynthetic Autotrophs
hyphae are densely packed so it is diﬃcult to see the individual structures when a mushroom
is eaten. However, a mushroom is only a specialised reproductive part of the whole fungus.
The main part of the fungi is underground in a whole web of hyphae, called a mycelium.
In the mycelium, each fungal cell is separated from each other by a septum. Each fungal
cell may have one or more nuclei and remains connected to the mycelium because the septa
are porous, allowing cytoplasm to ﬂow through the hyphae and fungal cell walls, made of a
hard material called chitin. Some fungi do not have septa, and they appear to be large,
branching, multinucleate cells.
23.24 Nutrition
Fungi are saprophytes. When they ﬁnd a source of food (e.g. dead wood, orange peel) ,
they decompose it and digest it. The enzymes break down larger organic molecules in the
substrate into smaller molecules. These smaller molecules diﬀuse into the fungus, where
they are used to allow growth and repair.
Fungi which feed on living cells are parasitic. For example, athlete's foot grows on the
human foot. These kinds of fungi produce hyphae called haustoria, which can penetrate
host cells without immediately killing them.
However, they are friendlier species of fungi. Many fungi live symbiotically with plants or
animals. For example, most trees have fungi living in close contact with their roots. In this
relationship, known as a mycorrhiza, there are many beneﬁts:
• Growing around the plant roots and often entering plant cells, the hyphae absorb minerals
from the soil and release them in the roots. The fungi gets its source of food (organic
nutrients) while delivering food to the plant.
• The mycelium here would increase the surface area, thus the absorptive surface, of the
plant roots.
• The fungal cells help to maintain air and water ﬂow in the soil around the roots.
• The fungi may prevent other potentially pathogenic fungi to attack the tree.
23.25 Fungal Reproduction
Fungi can reproduce in two ways. Firstly, they make asexually produce through frag-
mentation. This occurs when pieces of hyphae are broken oﬀ, which then grow into new
mycelia.
The second method is by spores. Spores are lightweight structures and windblown designed
to be transported over long distances and by many mediums, such as on the bodies of insects
and birds. They are additionally light enough to be blown away for hundreds of kilometers.
Spores may be asexual and sexual. Their sexual properties can be analysed to classify the
four phylla of fungi.
112Types of Fungi
23.26 Types of Fungi
23.26.1 Zygospore Fungi (Zygomycetes)
This phyllum includes bread moulds and other saprotrophs. Comparable to bacteria, this
phyllum prefers asexual reproduction over sexual reproduction.
1. Two haploid hyphae of opposite types, also known as mating strain + and mating
strain -, combine and fuse together.
2. Plasmogamy, the union of the two parent hyphae, occurs and results in the creation
of a heterokaryotic (n + n) zygosporangium or zygospore. Note that the zygospore is
NOT diploid yet; the haploid nuclei are simply clumped together.
3. Immediately, a thick wall develops around the zygospore to protect it from drying and
other hazards. The zygospore becomes dormant.
4. When conditions are favourable, the zygospore absorbs water and undergoes karyogamy
(n + n = 2n), where the haploid nuclei contributed by the two parents fuse to produce
diploid zygosporangia.
5. The now diploid zygosporangium then undergoes meiosis to form haploid sporangia.
6. Through asexual reproduction of fungi (See above for more information), the spores from
the sporangia germinate and grow into new mycelia.
7. Back to step #1.
23.26.2 Club Fungi (Basidiomycetes)
This phyllum increases mushrooms and shelf fungi. In many ways, the reproduction stages
of this phyllum is similar to that of zygomycetes.
1. Two haploid hyphae of opposite types, also known as mating strain + and mating
strain -, combine and fuse together.
2. Plasmogamy takes place, and a dikaryotic mycelium forms. The dikaryotic mycelium
grows faster then the haploid parental mycelia.
3. Environmental factors cause the dikaryotic mycelium to form compact masses which de-
velop into basidiocarps, short-lived reproductive structures. An example is the mushroom.
4. The basidiocarp gills are lined with terminal dikaryotic cells called basidia, which then
undergo karyogamy.
5. The basidia are now diploid. They undergo meiosis to develop haploid basidiospores, a
term referring to a basidiomycete's spores.
6. Stillremainingonthebasidiocarp, thehaploidbasidiosporeseject,fallfromthebasidiocarp,
and are dispersed by the wind when mature.
7. In a favourable environment, the basidiospores germinate and grow into short-lived
haploid mycelia.

23.27 Key Terms
synapomorphy
23.28 Introduction
What makes an animal an animal?
If animals are a monophyletic taxon, then animals should be able to be deﬁned by synapomor-
phies, (shared, derived characteristics). Ideally, we would NOT deﬁne this or any taxon using
symplesiomorphies (shared ancestral or primitive characteristics) or homoplastic characters
(the independent evolution of similarity, or "convergent evolution"). See pages 654 - 656 and
Fig. 32.6 in your text to review these concepts. As you consider the characteristics listed
below, ask yourself whether or not each is a synapomorphy.
23.29 Characteristics of an Animal
• There is no one universally accepted deﬁnition of an animal. The following treatment
follows your text, beginning on page 876.
• Animals:
• Are multicellular, heterotrophic eukaryotes ...
• Lack the distinctive cell walls of plants & fungi
• Share unique characteristics ...
• Share certain reproductive characteristics ...
• Other commonly used deﬁnitions ...
Animals are multicellular heterotrophic eukaryotes
• Unfortunately, none of these traits is exclusive to animals:
• Plants, fungi, and some algae are multicellular.
• Many bacteria, protists, and all fungi are heterotrophic.
• Everything other than bacteria and archaea are eukaryotic.
• Moreover, all three of these characteristics also apply to fungi.
• However, there is a diﬀerence here between animals and fungi. Animals generally
take in their food through ingestion, or eating and swallowing something. Fungi are
absorptive heterotrophs; they secrete their digestive enzymes onto their food, and then
absorb the resulting nutrients.
Animals share unique characteristics
• Only animals have muscle tissue and nervous tissue.
• Only animals have collagen, a structural protein
• Only animals have the following types of intercellular junctions: (See pages 135 - 139,
Figure 7.15 in your text for more information on these junctions.)
114Characteristics of an Animal
• Tight junctions (sealing function)
• Desmosomes (anchoring function)
• Gap junctions (communication function)
Animals share certain reproductive characteristics
• Most animals reproduce sexually, with the diploid stage dominating.
• In most animals, a small, haploid, ﬂagellated, motile sperm fertilizes a larger, haploid,
nonmotile egg to form a diploid zygote.
• Mitotic division of the zygote yields a blastula stage, followed by a gastrula stage. A
synapomorphy? This feature could be another "unique characteristic" shared by animals.
• Development may be direct to adult form, or there may be a sexually immature stage
(or stages) that are morphologically & ecologically distinct from the adult called a larva
(plural: larvae).
Other commonly used deﬁnitions or characterizations
• It is surprisingly diﬃcult to ﬁnd two texts that agree on a precise deﬁnition of an animal.
Here are a few perspectives from some other texts.
• Animals are multicellular eukaryotes; they are chemosynthetic heterotrophs that ingest
their food.
• Animals are motile, though many are secondarily sessile. Gametes usually are produced
inmulticellularsexorgans, andthezygotepassesthroughembryonicstagesthatinclude
a blastula.
• Animals are organisms that are multicellular, with more than one type of cell. They
are heterotrophic. They reproduce sexually (at least sometimes), with a zygote formed
from two diﬀerent haploid gametes. They go through a developmental stage called a
blastula.
• Animals are not photosynthetic, have no cell wall, and no hyphae or mycelia. (What
would a cladist think of this deﬁnition of the taxon Animalia?)
What kinds of animals are there?
• Kingdom Animalia generally is recognized to have approximately 30 phyla ...
• There is relatively little dispute over the number of phyla recognized; however, the
phylogenetic relationships among the phyla are hotly debated.
• Molecular techniques for assess similarity based on nucleotide sequences in nucleic
acids are providing valuable new perspectives on this question.
• Remember that two animals in diﬀerent phyla generally are considered to be more diﬀerent
from each other than are animals within one phylum (e.g., nematodes are more diﬀerent
from annelids than humans are from sharks).

23.31 Phylum Porifera
Figure 6 Sponges
Name means "pore-bearing".
This phylum consists of the sponges. The number of species is estimated to be between
5,000 and 10,000. All are aquatic and almost all are marine.
Animals in this phyla have no true tissues, which means, for example, that they have no
nervous system or sense organs. Although sponges are multicellular, they are described as
being essentially at a cellular level of organization. They are sessile as adults, but have a
free swimming larva.
Their bodies are porous. They are ﬁlter feeders; water ﬂows in through many small openings,
and out through fewer, large openings. They have inner and outer cell layers, and a variable
middle layer. The middle layer often is gelatinous with spiny skeletal elements (called
spicules) of silica or calcium carbonate, and ﬁbres made of spongin (a form of collagen).
117Multicellular Photosynthetic Autotrophs
Choanocytes are ﬂagellated cells lining the inside of the body that generate a current, and
trap and phagocytize food particles.
Their cells remain totipotent, or developmentally ﬂexible: they can become any type of
cell at any point in the sponge's development. This allows for the great regenerative power
sponges have.
Sponges are an ancient group, with fossils from the early Cambrian (ca. 540 mya) and
possibly from the Precambrian. Sponges often are abundant in reef ecosystems. They
somehow are protected from predators (spicules? bad taste?).
Many organisms are commensals of sponges, living inside them. Some sponges harbor
endosymbiotic cyanobacteria or algae (dinoﬂagellates, a.k.a. "zooxanthellae").
23.32 Phylum Cnidaria
See text pages 886 - 889.
Name comes from the Greek knide- meaning "nettle".
This phylum They have one opening, which serves as both mouth and anus. The body wall
has an outer ectoderm, an inner endoderm, and a variable undiﬀerentiated middle layer
called mesoglea or mesenchyme that may be jelly-like. The mesoglea is NOT considered
to be true mesoderm and so the Cnidaria are described as diploblastic. Tentacles usually
extend from the body wall around the mouth/anus.
118Phylum Cnidaria
Figure 7 Jellyﬁsh Development
14 15
There are two basic body plans: the polyp and the medusa . The polyp is sessile and
attaches to substrate by the aboral end (i.e., the end away from the mouth). The medusa
("jellyﬁsh") is a ﬂoating form, and looks like an upside-down version of the polyp. Some
cnidarians only have the polyp stage, some have only the medusa stage, and others have
both.
14 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polyp
15 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medusa%20%28biology%29
119Multicellular Photosynthetic Autotrophs
The typical life cycle of a cnidarian involves what is called "alternation of generations": an
alternation between an asexual polyp stage and a sexual medusa stage.
The tentacles are armed with cnidae (or nematocysts), small intracellular "harpoons" that
function in defense and prey capture. When ﬁred, the cnidae deliver a powerful toxin that
in some cases is dangerous to humans. The phylum is named after the cnidae.
Cnidarians have no head, no centralized nervous system, and no specialized organs for gas
exchange, excretion, or circulation. They do have a "nerve net."
Many cnidarians have intracellular algae living within them in a mutualistic symbiotic
relationship (Dinoﬂagellates = zooxanthellae). This combination is responsible for much of
the primary productivity of coral reefs.
There are three main classes in the phylum
16
• Class Hydrozoa (hydras and Portugese man-of-war are well-known but atypical examples
of this Class)
17
• Class Scyphozoa (jellyﬁsh)
• The medusa stage is dominant and the polyp stage often is reduced.
18
• Class Anthozoa (sea anemones, most corals)
• No medusa (jellyﬁsh) stage, so sexual reproduction occurs in the polyp stage in this
group. The polyps also can reproduce asexually, which is how individual "corals" grow.
23.33 Phylum Platyhelminthes
See text pages 890 - 893.
Name means "ﬂat worm"
Most members of this phylum are parasitic (ﬂukes and tapeworms), but some are free living
(e.g., planaria). There are about 20,000 species.
They are dorsoventrally compressed (i.e., "ﬂat").
Animals in this phylum are acoelomate, triploblastic, bilaterally symmetrical, and unseg-
mented. Platyhelminths have a simple anterior "brain" and a simple ladder-like nervous
system. Their gut has only one opening. Flatworms have NO circulatory or gas exchange
systems. They do have simple excretory/osmoregulatory structures (protonephridia or "ﬂame
cells").
Platyhelminths are hermaphroditic, and the parasitic species often have VERY complex
reproductive (life) cycles.
There are four main classes of platyhelminths:
19
• Class Turbellaria (mostly free living ﬂatworms, e.g., planaria)
16 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrozoa
17 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scyphozoa
18 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthozoa
19 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbellaria
120Phylum Rotifera
20
• Class Monogenea (parasitic ﬂukes)
21
• Class Trematoda (parasitic ﬂukes, e.g., liver ﬂuke and the human blood ﬂuke, Schisto-
soma)
22
• Class Cestoda (tapeworms)
• Cestodes are endoparasitic in the gut of vertebrates. They do not have a mouth or
digestive system.
23.34 Phylum Rotifera
See text page 900
The Rotifers. The name means "wheel bearing," a reference to the corona, a feeding structure
(see below).
They are triploblastic, bilaterally symmetrical, and unsegmented. They are considered
pseudocoelomates.
Most less than 2 mm, some as large as 2 - 3 mm.
Rotifers have a three part body: head, trunk foot. The head has a ciliary organ called the
corona that, when beating, looks like wheels turning, hence the name of the phylum. The
corona is a feeding structure that surrounds the animal's jaws. The gut is complete (i.e.,
mouth & anus), and regionally specialized. They have protonephridia but no specialized
circulatory or gas-exchange structures.
Most live in fresh water, a very few are marine or live in damp terrestrial habitats. They
typically are very abundant. There are about 2,000 species.
Parthenogenesis, where females produce more females from unfertilized but diploid eggs, is
common. Males may be absent (as in bdelloid rotifers) or reduced. When males are present,
sexual and asexual life cycles alternate. Males develop from unfertilized haploid eggs and
are haploid. Males produce sperm by mitosis which can fertilize haploid eggs, yielding a
diploid zygote that develops into a diploid female. Sexual reproduction occurs primarily
when living conditions are unfavorable.
Most structures in rotifers are syncytial ("a mulitnucleate mass of protoplasm not divided into
separate cells," or "a multinucleated cell") and show eutely (here, "constant or near-constant
number of nuclei").
23.35 Phylum Nematoda
See text pages 894 - 895.
Name from the Greek for "thread".
20 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monogenea
21 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trematoda
22 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cestoda
121Multicellular Photosynthetic Autotrophs
This phylum consists of the round worms. There are about 12,000 named species but the
true number probably is 10 - 100 times this!
These animals are triploblastic, bilaterally symmetrical, unsegmented pseudocoelomates.
They are vermiform, or wormlike.
In cross-section, they are round, and covered by a layered cuticle (remember this cuticle !!).
Probably due to this cuticle, juveniles in this phylum grow by molting. The gut is complete.
They have a unique excretory system but they lack special circulatory or gas-exchange
structures. The body has only longitudinal muscle ﬁbers. The sexes are separate.
Nematodes can be incredibly common, widespread, and of great medical and economic
importance. They are parasites of humans and our crops. They can live pretty much
anywhere.
In one rotting apple, there can be up to 90,000 nematodes, and in one tablespoon of coastal
mud, there can be 236 species of nematodes!
Nematodes can be free living or important parasites of our crops, or of humans and other
animals. They have become very important in development studies, especially the species
Caenorhabditis elegans, presumably due to its small size and constancy of cell number
(eutely - 959 cells in C. elegans).
23.36 Phylum Annelida
See text pages 906 - 909.
Name means "ringed", from the Greek annulatus.
This phylum consists of earthworms, leeches, and various marine worms given many diﬀerent
names (e.g., sand worms, tube worms). There are about 12,000 - 15,000 species.
Animals in this phylum are triploblastic, bilaterally symmetrical, segmented coelomates.
Development is typically protostomous. They have a complete circulatory system, and
a well-developed nervous system. Typically, each segment has paired epidermal "bristles"
(setae or chaetae).
Most are marine but they are successful occupants of almost anywhere suﬃcient water is
available. They can be free living, parasitic, mutualistic, or commensalistic.
Major advances of this phylum include the true coelom, segmentation, both longitundinal
and circular muscles, a closed circulatory system and, for most, a more advanced excretory
system (metanephridia).
There are three main classes of Annelids
• Class Oligochaeta (earthworms)
• Class Polychaeta (marine worms)
• Class Hirudinea (leeches)
122Phylum Arthropoda
23.37 Phylum Arthropoda
Figure 8 Arthropods
Name means "jointed feet".
This phylum consists of spiders, ticks, mites, insects, lobsters, crabs, and shrimp, and is the
largest of all the phyla. So far, over 1 million species have been named, and it is likely that
the true number out there is 10 - 100 times greater.
This phylum also includes the extinct trilobites, which were prevalent in the Paleozoic era.
Because of their exoskeletons, these animals fossilized well and over 4000 species have been
named.
These animals are triploblastic, bilaterally symmetrical, segmented, protostome coelomates.
The coelom is generally reduced to portions of the reproductive and excretory systems. They
have an open circulatory system.
Themostnotableadvancementofthisphylumisarigidexoskeleton. Ithasmajorimplications
in these organisms' locomotion, ﬂexibility, circulatory systems, gas exchange systems, and
growth. It also was partially responsible for the ability of the arthropods to move on to land.
There are several major groupings of arthropods:
Major subgroups include:
• The chelicerates (eurytperids, horseshoe crabs, scorpions, spiders, ticks) have clawlike
feeding appendages. They lack antennae and usually have simple eyes.
• The Trilobites...they get their own grouping
123Multicellular Photosynthetic Autotrophs
• The uniramians (centipedes, millipedes, insects) have one pair of antennae and un-
branched (uniramous) appendages.
• The crustaceans (crabs, shrimp, lobsters, barnacles and many others) have two pairs of
antennae and branched (biramous) appendages.
Major Classes Include
• Class Arachnida (mites, scorpions, spiders, ticks)
• Class Diplopoda (millipedes)
• Class Chilopoda (centipedes)
• Class Insecta (insects)
• Class Crustacea (crabs, crayﬁsh, lobsters, shrimp)
23.38 Phylum Mollusca
See text pages 900 - 905.
Name means "soft".
This phylum consists of snails, slugs, bivalves, chitons, squids, octopus, and many others.
About 110,000 species
All molluscs have a similar body plan:
• A muscular foot, usually used for movement.
• A visceral mass, containing most of the internal organs.
• A mantle, a fold of tissue that drapes over the visceral mass and secretes the shell, if
present.
• Most have a radula, or a rasping organ to scrape food.
Molluscs are bilaterally symmetrical, or secondarily asymmetrical. They are coelomates, but
the coelom generally has been greatly reduced; the main body cavity is a hemocoel. Devel-
opment is typically protostomous. The gut is complete with marked regional specialization.
Large, complex, metanephridia (excretion).
Many molluscan life cycles include a trochophore larva. This stage also is characteristic of
annelids.
There are several major classes of molluscs:
• Class Polyplacophora (chitons)
• Class Gastropoda (snails, slugs, nudibranchs)
• Class Bivalvia (clams, mussels, scallops, oysters)
• Class Cephalopoda (squids, octopuses, chambered nautiluses)
23.39 Phylum Echinodermata
Name means "spiny skin"
This phylum consists of sea stars, brittle stars, sea urchins, and sea cucumbers.
124Phylum Chordata
Echinoderms are mostly sessile or very slow moving animals.
As adults, they are radially symmetrical, but in the larval stage, they are bilaterally
symmetrical. They are considered deuterostomes.
Echinoderms are unique in that they have a water vascular system composed of a system
of ﬂuid-ﬁlled canals. These canals branch into the tube feet, which function in feeding,
locomotion, and gas exchange.
There are six major classes of echinoderms:
• Class Asteroidea (sea stars)
• Class Ophiuroidea (brittle stars)
• Class Echinoidea (sea urchins, sand dollars)
• Class Crinoidea (sea lilies)
• Class Holothuroidea (sea cucumbers)
23.40 Phylum Chordata
Name means "the chordates", i.e., these animals have a notochord at some stage in their
lifecycle.
This phylum consists of tunicates, lancelets, and the vertebrates.
There are four major features that characterize the phylum Chordata.
• A notochord, or a longitudinal, ﬂexible rod between the digestive tube and the nerve
cord. In most vertebrates, it is replaced developmentally by the vertebral column. This
is the structure for which the phylum is named.
• A dorsal hollow nerve cord which develops from a plate of ectoderm that rolls into a tube
located dorsal to the notochord. Other animal phyla have solid nerve cords ventrally
located. A chordate nerve cord splits into the central nervous system: the brain and
spinal cord.
• Pharyngeal slits, which allow water that enters through the mouth to exit without
continuing through the entire digestive tract. In many of the invertebrate chordates,
these function as suspension feeding devices; in vertebrates, they have been modiﬁed for
gas exchange, jaw support, hearing, and other functions.
• A muscular, postanal tail which extends posterior to the anus. The digestive tract of
most nonchordates extends the length of the body. In chordates, the tail has skeletal
elements and musculature, and can provide most of the propulsion in aquatic species.
Chordates have a segmented body plan, at least in development. This segmentation evolved
independently from the segmentation of annelids.
Three subphyla make up the phylum Chordata:
• Subphylum Urochordata (tunicates): the adults are enclosed in a tunic made of a carbo-
hydrate much like cellulose. They squirt water out of an excurrent siphon. Urochordates
are characterized by errant (mobile and active) larvae and sessile adults. All are ﬁlter
feeders. The only "chordate" characteristics retained in adult life are the pharyngeal slits.
125Multicellular Photosynthetic Autotrophs
Larval urochordates look more like adult cephlochordates & adult vertebrates than adult
urochordates.
• Subphylum Cephalochordata: Cephalochordates are known as lancelets because of their
blade-like shape; they are also known as amphioxus. They are marine animals and usually
live on the bottom, but can swim.
• Subphylum Vertebrata (vertebrates) ...
Formally, the phyla Urochordata and Cephalochordata are considered invertebrates.
23.40.1 Subphylum Vertebrata
Vertebrata refers to the presence of vertebrae and a vertebral column.
This subphylum includes most of the animals with which most people are familiar.
Vertebrates show extreme cephalization.
The notochord generally is replaced by the cranium & vertebral column in adults.
Neural Crest Cells
Later in development, these give rise to many cells of the body, including some cartilage
cells, pigment cells, neurons & glial cells of the peripheral nervous systems, much of the
cranium, and some of the cells of the endocrine system.
Some scientists would like to classify the neural crest as the fourth germ layer.
Neural crest cells come from the dorsal edge of the neural plate, thus ectoderm.
12624 Chordates
The phylum Chordata includes three subphyla. These include vertebrates and invertebrate
chordates.
24.1 Characteristics
Notochord: the rod-shaped supporting axis found in the dorsal part of the embryos of all
chordates, including vertebrates
Flexible, non-collapsible rod dorsal to the gut/coelom and below the nervous system,
hydrostatic, ﬂuid wrapped in tough connective tissue. As bone does not compact, muscles
tensed on one side result in movement instead of shortening the animal. This allows much
better locomotion than do cilia for larger animals in water, a crucial victory for later success.
Pharyngeal slits: Slits in the pharynx originally used to gather food, water enters the mouth,
passes through pharynx and out gill-like slits, passing through a cavity called an antrium
and then outside. In humans, present only in embryo.
Dorsal nerve cord: A neural tube dorsal to the notochord
Postanal tail: Elongation of the body and notochord, nerve cord and muscles past anus into
tail, early locomotive function led to success.
Non-synapomorphic characteristics (not limited to chordates):
• bisymmetrical (bilateral symmetry)
• segmented muscles and bones
24.2 Subphylum Urochordata
The tunicates are located in this subphylum. Along with the subphylum Cephalochordata,
these two subphyla make up the invertebrate chordates. Only the tunicate larvae have
notochords, nerve cords, and postanal tails. Most adult tunicates are sessile, ﬁlter-feeders
which retain their pharyngeal slits. Adult tunicates also develop a sac, called a tunic,
which gives tunicates their name. Cilia beating within the turnicate cause water to enter
the incurrent siphon. The water enters the body, passes through the pharyngeal slits,
and leaves the body through the excurrent siphon. Undigested food is removed through
the anus. Tunicates are hemaphrodites and can reproduce asexually through budding.In
urochordates notochord is conﬁned to larval tail.These lack cranium. These have an open
type of circulatory system.Excretion is by neural gland,nephrocytes.
127Chordates
24.3 Subphylum Cephalochordata
The lancelets are located in this subphylum. Along with the subphylum Urochordata, these
two subphyla make up the invertebrate chordates. Lancelets receive their name from their
bladelike shape. They resemble ﬁsh but they are actually scaleless chordates only a few
centimeters long. They spend most of their time buried in the sand with their mouths
protruding. Fossils of lancelets have been found to be over 550 million years old.
Dropped out sessile stage, what was the larval stage is now sexually reproductive. Includes
Branchiostoma (“amphioxus”).
24.4 Subphylum Vertebrata
(Vertebra from Latin vertere, to turn). Characterized by separate bones or cartilage blocks
ﬁrmly joined as a backbone. The backbone supports and protects a dorsal nerve cord.
Vertebrates have tissues which are organized into organs which in turn are organized into
organ systems.
All vertebrates share the following characteristics: - segmentation - a true coelom - bilateral
symmetry-cephalization-abackbone-abonyskull-aclosedcirculatorysystem-chambered
heart - two pairs of jointed appendages - tissues organized into organs
Vertebrate Organ Systems: - Nervous System - Circulatory System - Digestive System -
Respiratory System - Reproductive System - Excretory System
• Vertebral column: Not present in higher vertebrate adults. (In humans, the gel-like,
spongy core of the vertebral column is the only remainder. Ruptured or herniated disc is
an injury to this.)
• Cranium: Composite structure of bone/cartilage. Two functions: 1. Supports sensory
organs of head and 2. Encloses or partially encloses the brain.
What evolutionary relationship could we imagine between sessile echinoderms and the higher
chordate animals?
Paedomorphic (child-form) hypothesis: basically, evolution of sexual reproduction in what
had previously been a larval life stage, or the retention of at least one juvenile characteristic
into the adult (adult = sexually reproducing) stage. Some scientists believe that this occurred
in a proto-chordate animal lineage. Maybe chordates (and vertebrates) arose from sessile
(attached) ancestors. Selection in these proto-chordates maybe began to favor more time in
the larval stage, as feeding was more successful or mortality lower in this stage. As larvae
got bigger physics shows that the cilia become less eﬃcient for locomotion, favoring the
undulating motion allowed by a notochord.
Is this hypothesis crazy? A similar example of this today is Epemeroptera, the mayﬂy, which
has almost abandoned its adult stage. Its one-year lifespan is mostly larval with just a brief
day of reproduce-and-die as an adult, which doesn’t even have usable mouthparts.
Tunicate (sea squirt) larva has all four chordate characteristics, although adult sessile
(“attached”).
128Subphylum Vertebrata
24.4.1 Class Agnatha
"jawless ﬁsh"
• Ostracoderms: extinct Agnathans which had primitive ﬁns and massive plates of bony
tissue on their body.
• Cyclostomes: "circle mouth" - a group of Agnathans which is still alive in the form of
lampreys and hagﬁsh.
Appeared approximately 500 million years ago and dominated the oceans for about 100
million years. The ﬁrst group of ﬁsh to appear. They had neither jaws, paired ﬁns, nor
scales, but they were the ﬁrst organisms with a backbone.
Class Acanthodia
"spiny ﬁsh" Appeared about 430 million years ago. An extinct class of ﬁsh that developed
jaws with bony edges. They had internal skeletons made of cartilage and some bone.
Class Placodermi
Appeared about 410 million years ago, dominated the sea for about 50 million years. An
extinct class of ﬁsh with massive heads.
24.4.2 Class Chondrichthyes
"cartilaginous ﬁsh" Appeared about 400 million years ago with bony ﬁsh. Includes sharks,
skates and rays, and chimaeras. Their skeletons are made of cartilage strengthened by the
mineral calcium carbonate.
The main characteristics and distinguishing features of this class: - gills - single-loop blood
circulation - vertebral column - presence of placoid scales on their bodies - internal skeleton
of cartilage - paired, ﬂeshy pectoral and pelvic ﬁns - asymmetrical tail ﬁn prevents sinking -
fatty liver provides neutral buoyancy - visceral clefts present as separate and distinct gills -
no external ear - oviparous - internal fertilization - ectoderms - cold blooded
24.4.3 Class Osteichthyes
"bony ﬁsh" Appeared about 400 million years ago with cartilaginous ﬁsh. Includes about
95% of today's ﬁsh species.
Subclass Sarcopterygii
ﬂeshy-ﬁnned ﬁshes. Fins have bones and muscles, homologous to our limbs.
Order Dipnoi
lung ﬁshes, two groups isolated when continents separated
129Chordates
Order Crossopterygii
includes coelacanths and rhipodistians, gave rise to amphibians, had lungs which evolved
into a swim bladder in bony ﬁshes, and labyrinthodont teeth, characterized by complex
folding of enamel.
• Skeleton made of bone, jaws, ﬁns, most with scales, two-chambered heart.
24.4.4 Class Amphibia
means “both lives”, aquatic larvae, terrestrial adult Amphibians: - Legs - Lungs - Double-
Loop Circulation - Partially Divided Heart - Cutaneous Respiration (Breathes through
Skin)
Order Salientia
frogs (jumping) (aka Anura)
Order Urodela
salamanders (tailed)
Labyrinthodont amphibians: oldest known amphibians, inherited characteristic teeth from
crossopterygii ancestor, had stocky, aquatic larvae.
Amphibians have limbs instead of ﬁns. Girdles and vertebral column now more substantial
and connected, support body on legs.
Lisamphybia: no scales, “smooth”, eggs with no shell, laid in water (water-reliant).
Amphibians gave rise to cotylosaurs, from which arose dinosaurs, turtles, lizards, and
therapsids.
Class Reptilia
amniotic egg allowed freedom from water, shelled egg. (Amnion: protection). Reptiles have
four extra-embryonic membranes:
• Amnion: supports aquatic environment inside egg in ﬂuid sac.
• Allantois: allows gas exchange and elimination of wastes.
• Chorion: gas exchange
• Yolk sac: only one of the four left over from amphibian ancestor
Reptiles cold-blooded, or ectothermic, meaning that their heat come from their environment.
Sometimes deﬁned as all amniotes that are not birds or mammals.
Reptiles can be classiﬁed by skull structure into four groups:
• Anapsid
• Synapsid
• Diapsid
• Euryasid
130Subphylum Vertebrata
Refers to number of holes in the skull. Cotylosaurs had Anapsid skull
Dermatocranium: from bony outer skull structure, precursor to human cranium.
Subclass Anapsidia
Subclass Testudinata
1
turtles , terrapins
Subclass Diapsida
2 3
dinosaurs , snakes , most stuﬀ
Subclass Synapsida
Order Therapsids
Subclass Diapsida
includes Ichthyosaurs, marine reptiles convergent on dolphins; Plesiosaurs, ancient sea
monsters; Squamates, including lizards and snakes; and Thecodonts, which gave rise to
• birds
• dinosaurs
• crocodilians
Dinosaurs: broken into two groups, based on hip structure
• Saurischia: lizard hips (gave rise to birds [!]), ancestrally bipedal
• Ornithischian: bird hips, ancestrally quadripedal
Crocodilians: come from archosaurs, the only extant (still living today) archosaur descendant.
Ancestrally bipedal, secondarily quadripedal.
Synapsids: refers to joined (Greek syn-, together with) parts of skull. Led eventually to
mammals. Synapsid pelycosaur >> therapsid >> mammals
Pelycosaur: Sail-backed dinosaur, legs not spread out like lizard but more pillar-like and
under body, allowing greater activity and competence in motion, pendulum like rather than
constant push-up. Teeth diﬀerentiated into diﬀerent types, for pre-processing of food needed
by higher metabolism. Skull changes, bone histology, suggestions of warm-bloodedness.

epidermal derivative, made of keratin (like ﬁngernails). Carpometacarpis: bears primary
ﬂight feathers, parallel to hand parts. Keeled sternum: breastbone, powerful one needed
to support ﬂight muscles. Strong, light, occasionally hollow bones. All birds lay eggs (as
contrasted to reptiles, which have developed live birthing over 100 independent times.) Why
are there no live-bearing birds? Early birds had teeth, lost them. With mammals, only
exothermic animals.
Archaeopteryx: “ancient wing”, Jurassic bird-reptile, very dinosaur-like. Good fossils found
in Zolenhoﬀen, German sandstone mine with ﬁne sand, shows feathers clearly, found shortly
after Darwin’s publication and used to support his hypothesis. Thick, heavy bones and no
sternum, bony tail, not a good ﬂyer but did have primary ﬂight feathers.
Archaeornithes: includes archaeopteryx.
Paleognathae: gave rise to Australian ﬂightless birds.
Neognathae: remaining live birds.
Class Mammalia
Two unique characteristics, or synapomorphies:
• Hair
• Mammary glands
(don’t fossilize well)
Three skeletal characteristics (fossilize)
• Lower jaw only one bone, the dentary (several in reptiles)
• Three bones in middle ear: malleus, incus, stapes (reptiles have one or two, never three)
• Joint between upper and lower jaws between dentary and squamosal of skull (in reptiles
this joint is between other bones)
Mammals basically have a synapsid skull design inherited from ancestor
Non diagnostic characteristics (not unique to mammals):
• Warm-blooded
• Skin glands: sweat glands and oil-producing sebaceous glands
• Large nasal cavities (because of high metabolism) Clean, warm and humidify air
• Heterodonty (diﬀerentiated teeth)
• Diphiodonty: two sets of teeth: baby and adult (“deciduous” teeth, drop out) (reptile
teeth are continually replaced)
Subclass Protheria
monotremes (Greek mon-, one; and trema, hole), or egg-laying mammals, have one opening
for excretion and urination.
132Subphylum Vertebrata
Subclass Theria
Metatheria: Marsupials (opossum, kangaroo...) Eutheria: Placental mammals (all common
mammals)
Marsupium: (from Greek marsypion, purse or pouch). Gestation period much shorter than
in Eutherian mammals, but after leaving the uterus the tiny oﬀspring crawls into a pouch
where it completes development latched onto a teat.
Recent molecular (read: genetic) evidence suggests that two diﬀerent mammal groups
may have developed live-bearing ability separately. Instead of being a “rough draft” for
placental-style live bearing, perhaps the marsupial pouch approach is another solution to
the same problem. Advantage: in tough times the parent can pitch out the oﬀspring and
increase its own chance of survival.
13325 Tissues and Systems
13526 Epithelial tissue
Comes from various sources, ectodermal or endodermal material. Cell sheet lines a
surface or body cavity. One side, called freesurface or Apical, is exposed to
• animal interior (forming the lumen) or
• exterior of its body cavity.
The other side rests on the basal layer.
Epithelial tissue is not penetrated by blood vessels.
Two categories:
• sheets
• glands
Classiﬁed on two features:
• simple, (a single layer of cells),
• stratiﬁed, (more than one cell layer.)
Cell shape at free surface:
• squamous (broad and ﬂat)
• cuboidal (spherish)
• columnar (tall and thin)
Simple squamous epithelium
usually lines body cavities and vessels,alveoli, glomeruli of kidney; in blood and lymph
vessels called endothelium; in body cavities called mesothelium (serosae): parietal serous
membranes line body wall, visceral serous membranes cover organ
Simple cuboidal epithelium
in ducts like kidney and salivary glands.
Simple columnar epithelium
nonciliated type lines digestive tract, ciliated type lines some regions of uterine tubes and
lungs
Stratiﬁed squamous epithelium
(important) lines mouth, esophagus,and vagina. Cells sometimes dead, ﬂat and keratinized,
making them resistant to abrasion. Stratiﬁed squamous epithelium changes to columnar
squamous epithelium progressively down esophagus to the stomach.
Epidermis
137Epithelial tissue
from epithelium. Below this is dermis, thicker and with blood vessels.
Two specialized epithelia:
• pseudostratiﬁed
• transitional
Pseudostratiﬁed epithelia
lines the trachea (where it is ciliated)and the male urethra (where it is non ciliated), looks
stratiﬁed but not.
Transitional epithelia
found only in bladder and urinary system. As it stretches it appears to go from 6 to 3 cell
layers deep.
Glandular epithelia
(gland: group of cells that excretes something.. mostly derived from epithelium. Glands
are classiﬁed into endocrine and exocrine by where they excrete.
Endocrine glands
secrete hormones into the blood without use of ducts.
Exocrine glands
secrete onto the body surface or into a cavity, thru a duct. Exocrine substances include
sweat, mucous, oil, and saliva. An exocrine gland is the liver, which secretes bile.
13827 Connective tissue
This is a “grab bag” category of diverse tissue types. Functions include binding and
supporting. Types include bone, cartilage, ﬁbrous connective tissue, blood and
adipose (fat) tissue.
If you took away everything in the body except the connective tissue, you’d still be able to
see the basic form of the body.
Form: distinctivecellssurroundedbyacellmatrixmadeofextra-cellularﬁbergrounded
in a ground substance (excluding blood)
Types:
1. connectile connective tissues (can be 1. loose or 2. dense)
2. special connective tissue (includes blood, bones and cartilage).
Fibroblasts form connective tissue proper;
chondoroblasts form cartilage;
osteoblasts form bone;
and blood is formed from various sources.
Ground substance: “unstructured” material that ﬁlls space between cells and contains
ﬁbers. Made of
1. interstitial ﬂuid (bathes cells)
2. proteoglycans (protein core with attached polysaccharides, glycoaminoglycans or GAGs
such as chondroitin sulfate, keratin sulfate, and hyalronic acid, whose consistency is syrupy
to gelatin-like)
3. cell-adhesion proteins (connect connective tissue cells to the ﬁbers).
Fibers of connective tissue:
139Connective tissue
1. Collagen (ﬂexible protein resistant to stretching, tensile strength, most abundant
protein in animals, white)
2. elastin (rubbery, resilient protein, in dermis, lungs, blood vessels, yellow when fresh)
3. andreticulin (like collagen).
Loose connective tissue: found beneath skin, anchors muscles,nerves etc. Include ﬁ-
broblasts, macrophages, mast cells,and adipose cells. Fibers include collagen and
elastic ﬁbers. Ground substance is “syrupy”. Adipose included.
Dense connective tissue: largely densely packed ﬁbers of collagen or elastin regularly
or irregularly arranged. Forms tendons and ligaments, coverings of muscles, capsules
around organs and joints, and dermis of skin.
Cartilage vs. bone
Feature Bone Cartilage
cell type osteocytes chondrocytes
ground substance calcium phosphate chondroitin sulfate
vascularization vascular avascular
micro architecture highly ordered less organized
units called osteons
ﬁbrous sheath peristeum perichondrium
Cartilage: There are three cartilage types:
1. hyaline cartilage
2. ﬁbrocartilage (ﬁbrous cartilage)
3. elastic cartilage
Hyaline cartilage: most widespread cartilage type, in adults forms articular surfaces of
long bones, rib tips, rings of trachea, and parts of skull. Mostly collagen, name refers to
glassy appearance. In embryo, bones form ﬁrst as hyaline cartilage, later ossiﬁes. Found
in tracheal rings. Few collagen ﬁbers.
Fibrous cartilage: have lots of collagen ﬁbers. Found in intervertebral discs, pubic
symphesis. Grades into dense tendon and ligament tissue.
Elastic cartilage: springy and elastic. Found in internal support of external ear and in
epiglottis, yellow when fresh.
Chondrocites (cartilage cells) rely on diﬀusion for nutrients, as cartilage has no direct
blood supply, and no enervation (nerves). Can be loaded with calcium salts.
140Subphylum Vertebrata
Bone: Specialized connective tissue, calcium phosphate arranged in highly ordered unit
called osteon, or Hyvercian system. Concentric rings around central canal with blood
vessels and enervation (nerves). Bone varied, not all vertebrate bone is even cellular. Our
concern: simple pattern for mammals.
Lacuna (spaces in which osteocytes found); canaliculi (little canals) bigger diagonal cells,
layers of bone called lamellae.
Three types of bone cells, ending in
-blast, (mend bone)
-cyte (fortify bone)
-clast (tear down bone)
Classiﬁed by
1. appearance (spongy vs. hard)
2. where found (outside or inside)
3. how it is formed (endochondral cartilage model forms ﬁrst and then is ossiﬁed, and
entramembranous, bone forms directly without cartilage precursor)
Example of endochondral bone formation: long bone begins to ossify from center shaft,
calciﬁed region expands and cuts oﬀ diﬀusion of nutrients as bone replaces cartilage. In
young mammals, secondary ossiﬁcation centers then form at bone ends, growth has stopped
by sexual maturity as all primary bone is ossiﬁed. In other animals, bones continue growing
throughout their lifetime.
Three types of intramembrous bone:
1. dermal bone
2. sessamoid bone
3. perichondral bone.
Dermal bone forms skull, shoulder/pectoral girdle, and integument, descended from dermal
armor of ancestor. Comes from mesoderm, in dermis of skin.
Sessamoid bones: form directly in tendons. Example: kneecap, also in wrist. Deals with
stress.
Perichondral bone means “around cartilage,” forms around cartilage or bone. Func-
tions in bone repair and in ossiﬁcation of endochondral bone.
141Connective tissue
Bone remodeling and repair: bone has mineral structure, and develops tiny fractures,
which, under stress, can lead to larger fractures. To combat this, bone is constantly replaced.
Osteoclasts channel through existing bone, tear down and leave behind osteoblasts
and lacuna, leaving osteocytes. Continually resets mineral structure of bone, and is
preventative maintenance.
When bone broken, callus forms in open ends, periosteum gives rise to new bone with
calcium and new bone matrix, leaves irregular mend. Later, osteoblasts continue ﬁxing over
time and slowly removing imperfection.
14228 Muscle tissue
Mesodermal in origin, muscle has several functions: supply force for movement,restrain
movement, proper posture, act on viscera (internal organs) for peristalsis (moving food
down digestive tract), give body shape, form sphincters, (such as in esophagus, between
stomach and intestine, large and small intestine, in anus), in sheets of muscles, aﬀect air
ﬂow in and out of lungs, line blood vessels and play vital role in circulation.
Secondary roles: heat production (shivering a specialized heat production to supplement
metabolism).
Muscles co-opted to other non-original functions: sharks detect electrical ﬁeld created by ﬁsh
muscles. Some ﬁsh formed electric organs, create current strong enough to repel predators
or stun prey. Other ﬁsh can use ﬁeld as “radar” to see things and communicate with other
animals. (Evolved independently in diﬀerent groups).
Diﬀerent classiﬁcations: by color, (red or white) location, nature of nervous system
control (voluntary or involuntary), embryonic origin, or by general microscopic ap-
pearance (striated, smooth, and cardiac.)
Striated muscle (or skeletal muscle): under voluntary control. Individual cells called
ﬁbers, grouped into fascicle. Myoﬁbrils founding one cell made of even smaller myoﬁl-
aments. Each striated cell very long and multi-nucleated. Fibers joined end to end to
form longer composite ﬁbers. Sarcomeres: repeating units make up myoﬁbrils. Two
kinds of myoﬁlaments, thick kind made up of myosin and thin of actin. Striations visible
in light microscope, smaller part only with electron microscope.
Cardiac muscle: occurs only in heart. Light banding visible under light microscope.
Each band short, principally mononucleate (occasionally dinucleate) often branched, joined
together with intercollated discs. Involuntary. Waves of contraction spread through intercol-
lated discs. Initiated by nerve stimulation or can originate in the heart itself (useful in heart
transplants.)
Smooth muscle: no striations visible with light microscope. Almost entirely visceral
function: digestion, sphincters, urogenital tracts, piloerectory muscles (make hairs stand up),
lungs. Non-voluntary control. Slow and sustained action. Each cell mononucleate, short,
fusiform (spindly) in shape, cells usually uniform in size.
Striated muscle contraction: Muscle broken into units called fascicles, in units of myoﬁbrils.
Repeating units called sarcomeres, consisting of two kinds of myoﬁlaments:
1. thick, myosin ﬁlament
2. thin, actin ﬁlament.
143Muscle tissue
Sarcomere: Thick and thin ﬁlaments interspersed in ordered grid.
Sliding ﬁlament theory: thick and thin ﬁlaments move past each other in opposite
direction, shortening length. Longer muscles contract more rapidly than short ones (see cell
bio for details).
Myosin molecule: two polypeptides twisted together with two globular heads at end.
Myosin ﬁlament: many slender myosin molecules together.
Actin ﬁlament: chain of actin single, tropomyosin strands with repeated globular
troponin, and with actin. All play role in muscle contraction. Myocin heads have sites
that bind to actin. Actin ﬁlaments have many regular sites that can bind to myosin.
Troponin has four sites:
1. one to bind myosin
2. one for actin
3. one for tropomyocin
4. one for calcium ions
Nerve signal reaches muscle, triggers release of chemical signal called neurotransmitter,
that diﬀuses across cell membrane (sarcolimic reticulum) and binds to receptors in it.
Receptor is acetylcholine, ACH. When there is enough nerve signal, the message travels
through t-line to sarcoplasmic reticulum to release calcium ions.
Lacking calcium, tropomyosin site blocked. In calcium, myosin binding sites exposed and
heads bind to actin molecules, delivering force to move ﬁbers in relation to each other.
Myocin head then interacts with ATP to get “recocked”, if myosin still exposed then it
ﬁres again and results in further muscle contration. If there is no further nerve signal,
sarcoplasmic reticulum sequesters Ca+ ions again and no recocking occurs.
Quirari (or curare): known from movies, used in South America, blocks acetylcholine
receptors in cell and causes skeletal paralysis. Victim dies of asphyxiation because he can’t
breathe.
Duchenne's muscular dystrophy: degeneration of sarcolema, plasma membrane of
muscle cell unable to release signal and quickly atrophies.
Fast and slow twitch ﬁbers: vertebrate muscle ﬁber. Terms relative within one group
of animals. Diﬀerences related to diﬀerences in enervation, type of myocin, and actin
activation.
Two parts of force generated by muscle: 1. active component 2. elastic component (energy
stored in muscle when stretched by gravity or another force. Stored in muscle elastic tissue
around tendons. Especially important in limb oscillation, like running, or trunk twisting,
like ﬁsh swimming. Up to 90% of stored elastic energy can be recovered.)
144Subphylum Vertebrata
How does a muscle match its power to its job? Two ways:
1. rate modulation, derived from frequency of nervous stimulation of muscle, force
increases as frequency of stimulation increases up to point of tetanus.
2. selective involvement of motor units, a given neuron enervates a ﬁxed number of
muscle cells, (a motor unit), and force is increased by recruiting more motor units. Motor
units may be small, such as in eye, or larger, like in leg muscle.
How do muscles grow stronger?
1. add more myoﬁlaments, increases cross sectional area by up to 50%, more little ratchets
working
2. proliferation in blood vessels and connective tissue around muscle
Muscle strength is relative to cross sectional area, not length. Not always feasible to add
more cross sectional area.
Pinnate ﬁbers: oriented obliquely (Y-shaped) to minimize muscle mass, in certain circum-
stances, like calf muscle. Spreads muscle out.
Velocity of shortening greater in long muscle than short. Why? Contraction tied to relation
between ﬁbers, and to total length of muscle. Both long and short muscles reach same
percentage of contraction in same unit time, but distance covered by the longer muscle is
greater.
Synergist muscles: muscles work together to produce motion in same general direction.
Bicep shares work with brachialis.
Antagonist muscles: muscles that oppose each other. Bicep pulls forearm in, triceps pulls
it back out.
Origin vs. insertion: origin is the end of the muscle that more ﬁxed in its attachment to
the body. The more movable end called insertion.
Fixators: muscles that act to stabilize a joint or lever system. Like upper arm when you
clench your ﬁst hard.
Flexors and extensors: applied mainly to limbs. Flexor bends one part relative to another
about limb, extensor straightens it.
Adductor and abductor: adductor draws a limb toward the ventral surface. Abductor
moves limb away from ventral surface. (Adduct: drawn toward; abduct: carry away).
14529 Vertebrate digestive system
Functions to break down food into molecules small enough to absorb, or pass across digestive
membrane.
Digestive tract: tube extending from lips of mouth to anus or cloacae in bird, reptile or
monotreme.
Lumanal glands: empty into inner body cavity (lumen: inner surface).
Tract divided into three main regions: 1. buccal cavity 2. pharynx 3. alimentary canal
Alimentary canal divided into four regions: 1. esophagus 2. stomach 3. small intestine 4.
large intestine
Accessory digestive glands, outside digestive tract proper, secrete into lumen of tract
through ducts. Includes the salivary glands, liver and pancreas.
Buccalcavity, whichincludespalateandtongue, developsfrominfoldingofstomadeum,
or second opening of blastula, whereas the rest of the digestive tract develops from the
primitive gut.
Teeth: capture and hold prey. In mammals in particular further process and break down
food into small particles, increasing surface area available for enzymatic action.
Tooth anatomy: 1. crown projects above gum, 2. root below gum, 3. enamel is outer
coating of crown, hardest surface in body, of epideral origin 4. dentin, below enamel,
bone-like and forms bulk of tooth, is harder than bone and contains nerves and blood vessels.
(Remember that mammals are heterodontic, with diﬀerent types of teeth).
Pharynx: air passage for adult, gill slits in embryo. Important in lower vertebrates, site of
gills. Features derived from pharyngeal region: ﬁrst pharyngeal pouch gives rise to parts
of the ear, other pouches give rise to various other structures.
Alimentary canal: epithelium lines lumen, glands secrete into lumen, longitudinal and
circular muscles help digestive movements (peristalsis).
Esophagus: tube carries food from mouth to stomach. Expands to ﬁt large bolus (lump
of chewed food). Secretes mucus for lubrication. Birds have crop for storage, enlargement
of esophagus.
Epiglottis: keeps food out of air tube, an evolutionary “kludge,” or ﬁx.
Stomach. Absorbs water, alcohol, nutrients, uses gastric juice with enzymes, mucous, HCl,
released by chief and parietal cells (release protein enzymes) in gastric pits. Rugae: folds
of stomach, disappear when full. Sphincter at both ends of stomach, control food passage.
Chyme: semi-digested food released to small intestine.
147Vertebrate digestive system
Small intestine: three regions, duodenum, jejunum, and ileum.
Duodenum site of most intestinal digestion. Jejunum and ileum do most of intestinal
absorption. Ileum ends with another sphincter, ileocolic valve or ileosecal valve. Structure:
Circular folds covered with villi (singular is villus).
Villi: ﬁnger-likecellular projections, covered withmicrovilli, tinyprojectionswhichincrease
surfacearea. Increasessurfaceareaby900x, speedsdigestion(breakdown)andabsorption
(taking in nutrients).
Large intestine: larger diameter, shorter length than small intestine. No villi. In mammals,
forms large gentle loop, colon, empties into straight region, rectum, empties into outside
world through anal sphincter. Colon: absorbs water left over, also absorbs vitamins released
by bacteria which live there (vitamin K).
Food: made up of 1. proteins, 2. fats, 3. carbohydrates 4. ﬁbrous material.
Digestive system breaks foods down. Proteins must be broken to amino acids to be
absorbed. Polysaccharides to monosaccharides, lipids to fatty acids and monoglyc-
erides to absorb.
Salivary glands in mouth, saliva contains mucous, salt and a few enzymes (amalase, begins
starch breakdown). Snake venom from oral gland, mixture of toxins and digestive enzymes.
Breaks down blood vessels and disables nervous system.
Stomach enzymes: released in inactive form, zymogene, converts to active form in lumen
of gut. Transformation is triggered by another enzyme, or the stomach’s low pH. Pepsin
secreted as pepsinogen (-ogen means primitive form). Stomach glands secrete up to two or
three liters a day of gastric juice, which is reabsorbed.
Chyme released to duodenum.
Small intestine has two major accessory glands: 1. pancreas 2. liver
Pancreas has endocrine and exocrine functions, releases large amounts of carbonate to
neutralize acidic chyme, as intestinal enzymes work in neutral pH, and stuﬀ to break down
lipids and starch (zymogens, like tripsin)
Liver releases bile. Bile made from cholesterol, stored in gall bladder, released in
duodenum, emulsiﬁes fats.
Emulsify: keeps fats in tiny drops, which are suspended, increasing surface area and action
of lipases. Protein and carbohydrates absorbed in intestine, taken to liver for processing.
Fatty acids go to lymphatic system
Appendix: vestigial remnant. Much variation in digestive systems within mammals:
herbivore, carnivore, insectivore, non-ruminant herbivore.
Rumen: four-chambered stomach of animals like cows (ruminant herbivores). Cellulose
resistant to digestion, rely on microorganisms to break down cellulose. Some bacteria,
protists and fungi can break down cellulose, almost no animals can. Bacteria break down
cellulose in rumen, to be taken back to the mouth to chew their cud (ruminate). Later cow
swallows to proceed with digestion. (Horses not like this).
148Subphylum Vertebrata
Coprophagy: rabbits and other animals eat their own feces for the nutritious products of
the cecum.
14930 Circulatory system
Circulatory system functions
1. Transportation
a. Respiration: gas exchange (O2 and CO2), overcomes limited rate
of
diﬀusion
b. Nutrition:<br>
c. Excretory: (remove metabolic wastes)<br>
2. Regulation
a. Transport hormones<br>
b. Regulate body temperature<br>
c. Protection<br>
i. Blood clotting<br>
ii. Immune system (carries white blood cells)
Vasodilation: allows heat loss across epidermis, as seen in elephant ears, takes more blood
to surface of body, sweating may accompany
Countercurrent heat exchange: used by dolphins in ﬁns to conserve heat in cold water.
Veins surround an artery, and blood returning to body absorbs heat from blood traveling
out from body to ﬁn, minimizing heat loss. Used by dogs in feet, etc.
Blood made of 1. plasma and 2. formed cellular elements (red and white blood cells,
and platelets).
Plasma makes up 55% of blood volume. Cellular elements make up the other 45%.
Plasma makeup: 90% water, 7-8% soluble proteins (albumin maintains blood osmotic
integrity, others clot, etc.) 1% electrolytes 1% elements in transit
Red blood cell (erythrocyte): contains hemoglobin, functions in oxygen transport. In
mammals, red blood cells lose nuclei on maturation, and take on biconcave, dimpled, shape.
No self repair, live 120 days. About 1000x more red blood cells than white blood cells.
About 7-8 micrometers in diameter.
151Circulatory system
Hematocrit: proportion of blood volume that is occupied by cells, about 43% in humans
on average. 48% for men and 38% for women.
White blood cells (leukocytes): Nucleated, about 10-14 micrometers in diameter, com-
monly amoeboid, escape circulatory system in capillary beds. Include basophils, eosinophils,
neutrophils, monocytes, B- and T-cell lymphocytes.
Platelets (thrombocytes) Membrane bound cell fragments in mammals, no nucleus. In
non-mammals, platelet role replaced by nucleated cells. Accumulate at site of broken blood
vessels, form clots. Bud oﬀ special cells in bone marrow. 1-2 micrometers in diameter. 7-8
day life span, 1/10 or 1/20 as abundant as white blood cells.
Arteries: carry blood away from heart. Smallest tubes called arterioles, feed blood to
capillaries.
Veins: return blood to heart. Smallest veins called venules.
Structure of arteries and veins, listed from inside (lumen) out: 1. epithelium (endothelium),
2. elastic connective tissue ﬁbers, 3. smooth muscle, 4. connective tissue. Arteries
have thicker elastic layer than do veins.
Capillaries, where exchange of materials occurs, are very thin and narrow, and red blood
cells pass through single ﬁle. Capillaries are tiny but numerous, and their total volume is
greater than that of supplying arteries.
Blood velocity drops in capillaries, picks back up in veins. Pressure highest in arteries, lower
in capillaries and arteries.
Osmotic pressure draws interstitial ﬂuid from blood in arterioles, but replaces it in venules.
One-way valves mean that blood can ﬂow only one way, works with residual blood pressure
and compression by skeletal muscles. Low pressure in thoracic cavity caused by breathing
also helps move blood.
Lymphatic system: part of the immune system, a one-way, or open, system. Takes up
interstitial ﬂuid not taken up by venules.
Lymphatic structures:
1. lymphatic capillaries
2. lymphatic vesicles
3. lymph nodes
4. lymphatic organs (spleen and thymus)
Lymph: movement in mammals through one-way valves, similar to blood movement in
veins. (Some non-mammals have lymphatic hearts of unknown embryonic origin. Frogs and
salamanders have several.) Lymph rejoins cardiovascular system into a large vein near the
heart via single large thoracic duct.
152Subphylum Vertebrata
As lymph passes through system, passes lymphocytes, second part of immune system.
Heart: pumps blood, design varies between animals. In adult mammal,four chambers form
two separate circulations
1. pulmonary circulation to and from lungs and
2. systemic circulation to and from tissues of body.
Everything in the heart comes in pairs: 2 atria, 2 ventricles (left and right).
Diagrams usually drawn as though animal were on its back.
Pattern of blood ﬂow through heart: blood returning from major veins (vena cava)
enters rightatrium, contraction there delivers blood to rightventricle through atricuspid
valve, one of atrial ventricular valves (AV valve). Contraction of right ventricle drives blood
through semi lunar valve into pulmonary circuit and to lungs.Blood return to heart in
pulmonary veins, is oxygenated. Goes to left atrium, which contracts and delivers blood
to left ventricleby way of aortic semi-lunar valve, then goes to systemic circulation.
Both atria and ventricles contract in unison, left is more powerful than right (to all system
vs. just lungs).
Systole: heart contraction, diastole: heart relaxed
Timing of heart contraction: ventricles rebound to relaxed shape (diastole), and semi-
lunar valves close. Both atria(singular: atrium) ﬁll with blood coming from pulmonary
and systemic circulations.Pressure rises in the atria and blood begins to move into the
ventricles.The atria then contract, forcing more blood into the ventricles. There is a pause,
then ventricles contract. This raises ventricle pressure, atrio-ventricular(AV) valves
shut and semi-lunar valves open, forcing blood from the left ventricle into the major arteries
and from the right ventricle into the aorta.
Control for this action doesn’t rely on nervous stimulation, has intrinsic rhythmicity, called
myogenic. This is the case in mammal as well as in mollusk hearts. Other animals have
neurogenic hearts that rely on nervous stimulation for heart action, originating in the
cardiac ganglion.
The rhythmicity of mammalian heart relies on the sino-atrial (SA)node, or pacemaker.
This is a phylogenic (based on evolutionary history) remnant of an early vertebrate heart
that had one more chamber than modern hearts.
How the heart contracts: waves of depolarization start in SA node and spread
through atria. Connectile tissue pauses the spread of depolarization at the atrial ventricular
node. Signal continued by bundle branches to lower ventricle, begins to stimulate
heart to contract. Contraction starts at bottom of heart at heart apex,then signals spread
through heart.
Medulla (in the brain) controls autonomic nervous system. (The medulla is part of
the brain, is continuous with the spinal cord, and controls involuntary actions of the
body). Sympatheticcardiacacceleratorconnectstospinalcord, usesnorepinephrine
to signal. Parasympathetic cardio-inhibitory center reaches heart through Vagus
153Circulatory system
nerve, usesacetylcholine to signal. Hyperpolarizes membrane to inhibit heart contraction.
(Autonomic nervous system: two parts working in contra to control from both sides.)
Dominant eﬀect here is inhibitory. If we cut Vagus nerve, heart rate promptly rises about
25 bpm.
15431 Respiratory system
In humans and other animals, for example, the anatomical features of the respiratory system
include airways, lungs, and the respiratory muscles.
Other animals, such as insects, have respiratory systems with very simple anatomical features,
and in amphibians even the skin plays a vital role in gas exchange.
Plants also have respiratory systems but the directionality of gas exchange can be opposite
to that in animals. The respiratory system in plants also includes anatomical features such
as holes on the undersides of leaves known as stomata.
In mammals, the diaphragm divides the body cavity into the
abdominal cavity: contains the viscera (e.g., stomach and intestines)
thoracic cavity: contains the heart and lungs.
Respiratory tree: terminates in alveolus, alveoli. Respiratory bronchioles branch into
alveolar ducts and into alveoli. Alveolus: microscopic air sacs, 300 million of these in human
lungs. Total surface area large. Gas diﬀuses micrometer, very tiny distance.
Nervous System
Composed of tissues designed to integrate sensory information and direct a coordinated
response to the environment.
1
Basic unit of the nervous system is the neuron , a highly specialized cell that uses both
electrical and chemical processes to communicate. Neurons "listen" to sensory organs or
other neurons, and can simultaneously "hear" from 1 to hundreds of inputs simultaneously.
Likewise, a neuron can "talk" to other neurons or cells that can create an action, like muscle
cells or glands.
Neurons are outnumbered in the nervous system by glia. Glia were once thought to only play
a supportive role in helping neurons survive; today we know that they also are important
participants in the communication process. Glial cells include astrocytes, ependymal cells,
and a cell that has a macrophage like function. There are also oligodendocytes and Schwann
cells that provide a myelin sheath.

155Respiratory system
31.1 Neuron structure
Figure 9 Neuron
• Dendrite will receive information from other axons
• Stoma is the neuron body and contains typical cell parts including the mitochondria and
nucleus. This is where neurotransmitters are synthesized.
• Axon hillock is where the cell body and the axon meet.
• Axon is surrounded by myelin.
• Contains nodes of Ranvier
Types of axons include unipolar, bipolar, pseudopolar.
Action potentials results from excitatory stimuli received from the dendrites that results
in a signal that travels down the axon. On the cellular level, there is a Na+ inﬂux via
channels causing a depolarization of the cell. Once those channels close, the slower opening
K+ channels will open resulting in hyperpolarization by the cell.
Synapses
Neurotransmitters allow a chemical signal to be sent from one neuron to the other. Neuro-
transmitters must bypass a physical gap called the synapse. Examples of neurotransmitters
include acetylcholine, epinephrine, and glutamate.

156Central nervous system
Circuits / Nuclei / Ganglia
31.2 Central nervous system
Central nervous system includes the brain and the spinal cord.
Brain There are four lobes of the brain.
• Frontal lobe - decision making
• Parietal lobe
• Temporal lobe
• Occipital lobe - vision
The areas of the brain are also dedicated to diﬀerent functions.
• Precentral gyrus
• Postcentral gyrus
Protection The CNS is protected by three layers - the pia mater, the arachnoid mater, and
the dura mater. Protection also comes from the circulation of cerebral spinal ﬂuid (CSF).
CSF helps to ﬂoat the brain and also provide nutrients to both the brain and the spinal
cord. CSF is synthesized from the choroid plexus of the lateral ventricles. In total, there are
four ventricles - 2 lateral ventricles, a 3rd, and 4th ventricle.
31.3 Peripheral nervous system
The peripheral nervous system is broken down into two sub-systems, the somatic nervous
system and the autonomic nervous system.
ANS - Autonomic Nervous System The ANS has two components - parasympathetic and
sympathetic.
The sympathetic nervous system is the "ﬁght or ﬂight" or fright response and results in an
increased heart rate, increased rate of breathing, and an elevated blood glucose level. There
is also decreased digestion. The second neurotransmitter is epinephrine. In this case, the
ﬁrst neuron is short and the second neuron is long.
The parasympathetic nervous system is the rest and digest system.
Drugs must be able to pass the blood brain barrier to have an eﬀect on the CNS. Drugs act
by aﬀecting the neuron and how likely it is to ﬁre an action potential.
Stroke occurs when there is a blood clot that goes to the brain and prevent blood ﬂow.
15732 Sensory systems
Categorized by
1. nature of stimulus, such as mechanical, chemicalor light stimulus, and
2. where stimulus received, such as outside (exteroceptors,such as the eye and
skin temp receptors) or insidebody (interoceptors, such as blood body tem-
perature receptors).
Transduction of sensory input into signal. Means to “carry across”,signal transduced, or
carried, from environment into nervous signal.
Three sensory processes we cover
1. taste and smell (chemoreception)
2. gravity and movement
3. light
32.1 Taste and smell (chemoreception)
Found in mammal nose and mouth, ﬂy feet, ﬁsh bodies, moth antennae.
Papilla: bumps on tongue, contain taste buds down between. Sweet, sour, salty and bitter.
Some act directly by ion channels, others act indirectly. Other “taste” sensations really
smell.
Smell: received in nasopharynx. Airborne molecules go into solution on moist epithelial
surface of nasal passage. Approximately 1000 genescode for sensory neuron receptors. “Fried
onions” odor not one receptor but a mixture of many odors registered in our mind as one.
Very sensitive, habituates rapidly (don’t notice a smell after a bit). Odor sensation has
relatively unﬁltered root to higher brain centers.
Snakes more chemosensory focused than us.
32.2 Response to gravity and movement
Registered in inner ear. Three semicircular canals loop in three planes at right angles
to each other, responsible for transduction of movement messages. Method: hair cells
159Sensory systems
deformed by gelatinous membrane. Vestibular apparatus, gives us perception of gravity
and movement. Due to physical response, not chemical binding.
Cochlea: bony, coil shaped part of inner ear, where hearing occurs.
Sound enters throughauditory canal, vibratestympanic membrane,moving three bones
of middle ear (malleus, incus, and stapes)against oval window opening in front of cochlea.
Cochlea has three ﬂuid ﬁlled ducts, one of these the organ of Corti. Sound waves in air
go to vibration in organ of Corti; ﬂuid tickles hair cells, which register the movement
along basilar membrane in cochlea. Diﬀerent sound frequencies move diﬀerent portions
of basilar membrane. Hearing loss due to loss of hair cells.Humans normally smell more
than 300 odors in a day(Facts and Truth).
Transduction of sound accomplished throgh physical deformation,not chemical binding.
32.3 Vision
Light enters pupil, focused by lensonto retina.
Sclera: hardened part behind retina.
Optic nerves and neurons attached to retina. Blind spot where optic nerve attaches, has
no receptors.
Two types of photoreceptors
1. rods - black and white low-light vision, 100 million in each retina in humans.
2. cones - color vision, work best under better illumination. 3 million in each retina.
Fovia: region of most acute vision, has most of the cones, few rods.
Transduction process of light to signal a molecular change, to light absorbing molecule
called photopigment. Located in outer parts of rods and cones in pigment discs. The rod
photopigment is called rhodopsin,cone has three photopigments, called photopsins. This
molecular change initiates pathways to result in action potential in downstream neuron
leading to vision center in brain.Parul Godika
Each of the three photopsins has a diﬀerent peak of sensitivity: blue,green or red, and
changes isometric form (from cisto trans) based on light from a particular wavelength
range. Color blindness:inherited lack of one or more types of these cones. Gene carried on X
chromosome, therefore more common in men than women.
32.4 Homeostasis
Is a very important part of everyone's and everything's lives. Deﬁned as dynamic con-
stancy of internal environment, maintenance of a relatively stable environment inside
an organism usually involving feedback regulation.
160Osmotic environments and regulations
Homeostasis is maintained in face of
1. a varying external environment, or
2. a non-ideal, constant external environment (as with the penguin).
Deals with temperature, pH, chemical concentrations,pressure, oxygen levels.
Occurs through negative feedback loops.
Various forms: simple thermostat in house turns oﬀ heater when above a certain temperature
and on when below a certain temperature Involves stimulus, sensor,integrating center,
eﬀector and response.
More eﬃcient control has two sensors and two eﬀectors. Can be antagonistic to each
other, such as, one cools, the other heats.
Precise control through proportional control, not all-or-none, furnace comes on a little
bit if the house a bit cold. Examples in humans: vasoconstriction, change in metabolic rate,
shivering. Physiological responses for high body temp: blood goes to body surface, sweating,
behavioral changes (get out of sun).
Positive feedback loop: eﬀector increases deviation from set point. Ampliﬁes reaction.
Like blood clotting process, uterine contraction during childbirth. Negative feedback must
exist at some point for control.
32.5 Osmotic environments and regulations
1. Marine invertebrates
a) fully marine invertebrates (not intertidal or estuarine) osmoconformers (set
internal environment same as environment, no net ﬂow of ions) in a stenohaline
(narrow non-changing salt level) environment
b) Coastal, intertidal, estuarine (ion levels ﬂuctuate) invertebrates.Partly osmo-
confomers, partly osmoregulators in a euryhaline (wide salt level variation)
environment (ex: shore crab, regulates sometimes when salt levels in environment
get real low).
2. Freshwater animals. Here, environment has lower solute concentrations than do
living organisms so water tends to ﬂow in and solutes out.
a) Freshwater ﬁsh (bony) dilute urine, and gills actively take up ions (NaCl)
b) Freshwater invertebrates: same situation as freshwater ﬁsh but with diﬀerent
structures
c) Freshwater amphibians: active uptake of salts across their skin
3. Marine ﬁshes: Here the environment has a higher solute concentration than does
the organism so water tends to ﬂow out and ions in.
a) Bony ﬁshes: actively secrete salts (NaCl) across gills, absorb water across gut
wall, their kidney (unlike mammalian kidney) is unable to generate concentrated
urine so glomerulus is reduced, active tubular secretion of MgSO
4
b) cartilaginous ﬁshes (and coelacanth): blood retains urea and trimethylamineoxide
to increase its osmolality to that of seawater
161Sensory systems
4. Terrestrial animals: here problem is loss of water to a drier environment, and
regulation of salt levels.
a) water loss adaptations
b) concentrated exception of salts and nitrogenous wastes
Hypoosmotic: having less osmotic potential than nearby ﬂuid
Hyperosmotic: having more osmotic potential than nearby ﬂuid
Isoosmotic: having equal osmotic potential than nearby ﬂuid
Glomerulus: reduces volume of kidney
Fish started in salt water, spread to fresh water, later reinvaded salt-water environment.
Terrestrial animal water sources:
1. drinking
2. moist foods
3. from breakdown of metabolic molecules like fats. (Desert kangaroo rats get 90% of their
water from metabolism.)
Secretion of nitrogenous wastes: from metabolism of amino acids, amino group has to be
removed in one of three basically interchangeable chemical forms:
1. ammonia (aquatic life)
2. urea (mammals)
3. uric acid (birds)
Ammonia very toxic, soluble, and cheap to produce. Easy to expel for bony ﬁshes.
Urea: low toxicity, good solubility, more costly to lose as it contains other groups on it.
Must be released in solution, water cost.
Uric acid (white part of bird poo) low toxicity, insoluble, secreted with little water loss,
more costly side groups lost than the others.
Mammalian kidney: Structure: ﬁst-sized organ in lower back. About 1/5 of blood from
aorta at any time is passing through kidneys. Blood passes through kidney many times a
day.
Nephron: structural and functional unit of kidney.
Bowmans capsule: funnel-like opening, contains primary ﬁlter, the glomerulus.
Proximal convoluted tubule: receives stuﬀ from Bowmans capsule.
Loop of Henle: descends and ascends.
162Osmotic environments and regulations
Vasa recta: capillaries that surround the Loop of Henle.
Glomerulus: main ﬁlter of the nephron, located within the Bowman's capsule
Kidney properties and processes important to its function
1. Active transport of solutes from one ﬂuid to another against a concentration gradient,
+
Na actively transported out of ﬁltrate by cells of the thick ascending loop of Henley into
the interstitial ﬂuid
2. Passive movement of solutes and water from one ﬂuid to another(down a concen-
tration gradient), movement of water and NaCl out of descending loop of Henley into
interstitial ﬂuid.
3. Diﬀerential permeability of cells in diﬀerent regions of the nephron to movement
of water and solutes, ascending thick look is impermeable to water, descending portion is
permeable to water
4. Hormonal control of that permeability, antidiuretic hormone(ADH) increases
permeability of collecting due to water, resulting in reduced volume of ﬁltrate and thus
more concentrated urine.
5. Increasing solute concentration in the interstitial ﬂuid of the kidney, from the
cortex to the deepest medulla, maintained by a countercurrent multiplier mechanism

11 Getting Started
32 Biology - The Life Science
The word biology means, "the science of life", from the Greek bios, life, and logos, word
or knowledge. Therefore, Biology is the science of Living Things. That is why Biology is
sometimes known as Life Science.
1
The science has been divided into many subdisciplines, such as botany , bacteriology,
2 3
anatomy , zoology, histology, mycology, embryology, parasitology, genetics , molecular biol-
4 5 6 7
ogy , systematics, immunology, microbiology , physiology, cell biology , cytology, ecology ,
and virology. Other branches of science include or are comprised in part of biology studies,
8
including paleontology , taxonomy, evolution, phycology, helimentology, protozoology, en-
tomology, biochemistry, biophysics, biomathematics, bio engineering, bio climatology and
anthropology.
2.1 Characteristics of life
Not all scientists agree on the deﬁnition of just what makes up life. Various characteristics
describe most living things. However, with most of the characteristics listed below we can
think of one or more examples that would seem to break the rule, with something nonliving
being classiﬁed as living or something living classiﬁed as nonliving. Therefore we are careful
not to be too dogmatic in our attempt to explain which things are living or nonliving.
• Living things are composed of matter structured in an orderly way where simple
molecules are ordered together into much larger macromolecules.
An easy way to remember this is GRIMNERD C All organisms; - Grow, Respire, Interact,
Move, Need Nutrients, Excrete (Waste), Reproduce,Death, Cells (Made of)
• Living things are sensitive, meaning they are able to respond to stimuli.
• Living things are able to grow, develop, and reproduce.
• Living things are able to adapt over time by the process of natural selection.
9
• All known living things use the hereditary molecule, DNA .

5Biology - The Life Science
• Internal functions are coordinated and regulated so that the internal environment of a
10
living thing is relatively constant, referred to as homeostasis .
11
Living things are organized in the microscopic level from atoms up to cells . Atoms are
12 13
arranged into molecules, then into macromolecules , which make up organelles , which
work together to form cells. Beyond this, cells are organized in higher levels to form entire
14
multicellular organisms. Cells together form tissues , which make up organs, which are
part of organ systems, which work together to form an entire organism. Of course, beyond
this, organisms form populations which make up parts of an ecosystem. All of the Earth's
ecosystems together form the diverse environment that is the earth.
Example:-
sub atoms, atoms, molecules, cells, tissues, organs, organ systems, organisms, population,
community, eco systems
2.2 Nature of science
Science is a methodology for learning about the world. It involves the application
of knowledge.
The scientiﬁc method deals with systematic investigation, reproducible results, the
formation and testing of hypotheses, and reasoning.
Reasoning can be broken down into two categories, induction (speciﬁc data is used to
develop a generalized observation or conclusion) and deduction (general information leads
to speciﬁc conclusion). Most reasoning in science is done through induction.
Science as we now know it arose as a discipline in the 17th century.
2.3 Scientiﬁc method
The scientiﬁc method is not a step by step, linear process. It is an intuitive process, a
methodology for learning about the world through the application of knowledge. Scientists
must be able to have an "imaginative preconception" of what the truth is. Scientists will
often observe and then hypothesize the reason why a phenomenon occurred. They use all
of their knowledge and a bit of imagination, all in an attempt to uncover something that
might be true. A typical scientiﬁc investigation might go like so:
You observe that a room appears dark, and you ponder why the room is dark. In an attempt
to ﬁnd explanations to this curiosity, your mind unravels several diﬀerent hypotheses. One
hypothesis might state that the lights are turned oﬀ. Another hunch might be that the
room's lightbulb has burnt out. Worst yet, you could be going blind. To discover the truth,

11 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cell
12 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/macromolecule
13 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/organelle
14 http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/General%20Biology%2FTissues
6Scientiﬁc method
you experiment. You feel your way around the room and ﬁnd a light switch and turn it on.
No light. You repeat the experiment, ﬂicking the switch back and forth. Still nothing. That
means your initial hypothesis, the room is dark because the lights are oﬀ, has been rejected.
You devise more experiments to test your hypotheses, utilizing a ﬂashlight to prove that
you are indeed not blind. In order to accept your last remaining hypothesis as the truth,
you could predict that changing the light bulb will ﬁx the problem. If all your predictions
succeed, the original hypothesis is valid and is accepted. In some cases, however, your
predictions will not occur, in which you'll have to start over. Perhaps the power is oﬀ.
Figure 1 How Science is Done
A diagram that illustrates scientiﬁc investigation
Scientists ﬁrst make observations that raise a particular question. In order to explain the
observed phenomenon, they develop a number of possible explanations, or hypotheses. This
is the inductive part of science, observing and constructing plausible arguments for why
7Biology - The Life Science
an event occurred. Experiments are then used to eliminate one of more of the possible
hypotheses until one hypothesis remains. Using deduction, scientists use the principles of
their hypothesis to make predictions, and then test to make sure that their predictions are
conﬁrmed. After many trials (repeatability) and all predictions have been conﬁrmed, the
hypothesis then may become a theory.
Quick Deﬁnitions
Observation - Quantitative and qualitative measurements of the world.
Inference - Deriving new knowledge based upon old knowledge.
Hypotheses - A suggested explanation.
Rejected Hypothesis - An explanation that has been ruled out through experimentation.
Accepted Hypothesis - An explanation that has not been ruled out through excessive
experimentation and makes veriﬁable predictions that are true.
Experiment - A test that is used to rule out a hypothesis or validate something already
known.
Scientiﬁc Method - The process of scientiﬁc investigation.
Theory - A widely accepted hypothesis that stands the test of time. Often tested, and
usually never rejected.
The scientiﬁc method is based primarily on the testing of hypotheses by experimentation.
This involves acontrol, or subject that does not undergo the process in question. A scientist
will also seek to limit variables to one or another very small number, single or minimum
number of variables. The procedure is to form a hypothesis or prediction about what you
believe or expect to see and then do everything you can to violate that, or falsify the
hypotheses. Although this may seem unintuitive, the process serves to establish more ﬁrmly
what is and what is not true.
A founding principle in science is a lack of absolute truth: the accepted explanation is the
most likely and is the basis for further hypotheses as well as for falsiﬁcation. All knowledge
has its relative uncertainty.
Theories are hypotheses which have withstood repeated attempts at falsiﬁcation. Common
theories include evolution by natural selection and the idea that all organisms consist of
cells. The scientiﬁc community asserts that much more evidence supports these two ideas
than contradicts them.
8Charles Darwin
2.4 Charles Darwin
Figure 2
Charles Darwin is most remembered today for his contribution of the theory of evolution
through natural selection.
The seeds of this theory were planted in Darwin's mind through observations made on a
ﬁve-year voyage through the New World on a ship called the Beagle. There, he studied
fossils and the geological record, geographic distribution of organisms, the uniqueness and
relatedness of island life forms, and the aﬃnity of island forms to mainland forms.
Upon his return to England, Darwin pondered over his observations and concluded that
evolution must occur through natural selection. He declined, however, to publish his work
because of its controversial nature. However, when another scientist, Wallace, reached similar
conclusions, Darwin was convinced to publish his observations in 1859. His hypothesis
revolutionized biology and has yet to be falsiﬁed by empirical data collected by mainstream
scientists.
2.5 After Darwin
Since Darwin's day, scientists have amassed a more complete fossil record, including
microorganisms and chemical fossils. These fossils have supported and added subtleties
to Darwin's theories. However, the age of the Earth is now held to be much older than
Darwin thought. Researchers have also uncovered some of the preliminary mysteries of
the mechanism of heredity as carried out through genetics and DNA, areas unknown to
Darwin. Another growing area is comparative anatomy including homology and analogy.
Today we can see a bit of evolutionary history in the development of embryos, as certain
(although not all) aspects of development recapitulate evolutionary history.
9Biology - The Life Science
15
The molecular biology study of slowly mutating genes reveal considerable evolutionary
history consistent with fossil and anatomical record.
2.6 Challenges to Darwin
Figure 3
Darwin and his theories have been challenged many times in the last 150 years. The
challenges have been primarily religious based on a perceived conﬂict with the preconceived
notion of creationism. Many of those who challenge Darwin have been adherents to the
young earth hypothesis that says that the Earth is only some 6000 years old and that all
species were individually created by a god. Some of the proponents of these theories have
suggested that chemical and physical laws that exist today were diﬀerent or nonexistent in
earlier ages. However, for the most part, these theories are either not scientiﬁcally testable
and fall outside the area of attention of the ﬁeld of biology, or have been disproved by one
or more ﬁelds of science.

Cleveland State University.
Proteins: Their building block is amino acids. The bond connecting 2 of the amino acids
together are called peptide bonds. One of these bonds makes a monopeptide, two a dipeptide,
and any more than that makes a polypeptide.

185 Life: History and Origin
5.1 Properties of life
1. Organization: Being structurally composed of one or more cells, which are the basic
units of life.
• prokaryote: no nucleus
• eukaryote: membrane bound nucleus.
2. Sensitivity: respond to stimuli.
3. Energy Processing
4. Growth and Development
5. Reproduction
• hereditary mechanisms to make more of self; DNA based.
6. Regulation, including homeostasis.
7. Evolution.
5.2 Origin of life: 3 hypotheses
• Extraterrestrial origin (panspermia): meteor, comet borne from elsewhere in universe
• evidence of amino acids and other organic material in space (but often both D & L
forms)
• questionable bacterial fossils in Martian rock
-However, this would imply that some other origin of life was likely because it would have
had to happen elsewhere before it could be transported here, and the only diﬀerence would
be that life did not originate on Earth.
• Spontaneous origin on earth: primitive self-replicating macromolecules acted upon by
natural selection ((macro)Evolution is one example of this)
-This is often attacked for the seeming impossibility for life to have been produced by a
chemical reaction triggered by lightning and the ability of any produced DNA to actually be
in a sequence that could produce a working model of life if replicated. It is also attacked
for religious reasons, as it bypasses things like the idea of a supreme being directly creating
humans. It also seems unlikely to some that such huge changes are possible in evolution
19Life: History and Origin
without evidence of an "in-between stage" that is credible. Many of the stages of man are
disputed due to their somewhat shakey grounds. For example, bones from other animals
have been taken accidentally in some cases to be part of a humanoid, and complete skeletons
have been sketched out from a limited number of bones.
• Special creation: religious explanations (Intelligent Design is one popular example of
this.) These explanations contend that life was created by God (or perhaps some other
Intelligent Designer).
• Proponents of Intelligent design suggest that the vast complexity of life could only
have been intentionally designed while other creationists cite biblical support.
-This is often attacked for many of the same reasons that religion is attacked, and is often
regarded as superstitious and/or unscientiﬁc.
• It is debated as to whether schools should teach one hypothesis or the other when talking
about the origin of life. However, since they are all currently known major hypotheses
(and sometimes hypotheses proven wrong are shown for educational purposes), this
wikibook includes what it can without discriminating unfairly against one hypothesis or
the other.
5.3 The early earth
It is believed that the Earth was formed about 4.5 billion years ago.
• Heavy bombardment by rubble ceased about 3.8 billion years ago.
• Reducing atmosphere: much free H
• also H O, NH , CH
2 3 4
• little, if any, free O
2
• with numerous H electrons, require little energy to form organic compounds with C
• Warm oceans, estimated at 49-88°C
• Lack of O and consequent ozone (O ) meant considerable UV energy
2 3
Chemical reactions on early earth
• UV and other energy sources would promote chemical reactions and formation of organic
molecules
• Testable hypothesis: Miller-Urey experiment
• simulated early atmospheric conditions
• found amino acids, sugars, etc., building blocks of life
• won Nobel prize for work
• experiment showed prebiotic synthesis of biological molecules was possible
Issues
• Miller later conceded that the conditions in his experiments were not representative of
what is currently thought to be those of early earth
• He also conceded that science has no answer for how amino acids could self-organize into
replicating molecules and cells
• In the 50 years since Miller-Urey, signiﬁcant issues and problems for biogenesis have been
identiﬁed. This is a weak hypothesis at this time.
20Origin of cells
• Conclusion: Life exists, we don't know why.
5.4 Origin of cells
Cells are very small and decompose quickly after death. As such, fossils of the earliest cells
do not exist. Scientists have had to form a variety of theories on how cells (and hence life)
was created on Earth.
• Bubble hypothesis
• A. Oparin, J.B.S. Haldane, 1930’s
• Primary abiogenesis: life as consequence of geochemical processes
• Protobionts: isolated collections of organic material enclosed in hydrophobic bubbles
• Numerous variants: microspheres, protocells, protobionts, micelles, liposomes, coacer-
vates
• Other surfaces for evolution of life
• deep sea thermal vents
• ice crystals
• clay surfaces
• tidal pools
5.5 The RNA world?
• DNA→ RNA→ polypeptide (protein)
• Catalytic RNA: ribozyme
• discovered independently by Tom Cech and Sid Altman (Nobel prize)
• catalytic properties: hydrolysis, polymerization, peptide bond formation, etc.
• Self-replicating RNA molecule may have given rise to life
• consistent with numerous roles for RNA in cells as well as roles for ribonucleotides
(ATP)
• relationship to bubble-like structures is uncertain
5.6 The earliest cells
• Microfossils
• ˜3.5 by
• resemble bacteria: prokaryotes
• biochemical residues
• stromatolites
• Archaebacteria (more properly Archaea)
• extremophiles: salt, acid, alkali, heat, methanogens
• may not represent most ancient life
• Eubacteria
• cyanobacteria: photosynthesis
• atmospheric O ; limestone deposits
2
21Life: History and Origin
• chloroplasts of eukaryotes
Cyanobacteria
5.7 Major steps in evolution of life
• Prebiotic synthesis of macromolecules
• Self replication
• RNA? (primitive metabolism)
• DNA as hereditary material
• 1st cells
• Photosynthesis
• Aerobic respiration
• Multicellularity (more than once)

226 Cells
237 Cell structure
7.1 What is a cell?
The word cell comes from the Latin word "cella", meaning "small room", and it was ﬁrst
coined by a microscopist observing the structure of cork. The cell is the basic unit of all
living things, and all organisms are composed of one or more cells. Cells are so basic and
critical to the study of life, in fact, that they are often referred to as "the building blocks of
life". Organisms - bacteria, amoebae and yeasts, for example - may consist of as few as one
cell, while a typical human body contains about a trillion cells.
According to Cell Theory, ﬁrst proposed by Schleiden and Schwann in 1839, all life consists
of cells. The theory also states that all cells come from previously living cells, all vital
functions (chemical reactions) of organisms are carried out inside of cells, and that cells
contain necessary hereditary information to carry out necessary functions and replicate
themselves.
All cells contain:
1
• Lipid bilayer boundary (plasma membrane )
2
• Cytoplasm
3
• DNA (hereditary information)
4
• Ribosomes for protein synthesis
Eukaryotic cells also contain:
5
• At least one nucleus
6
• Mitochondria for cell respiration and energy
Cells may also contain:
7
• Lysosomes
8
• Peroxisomes
9
• Vacuoles
10
• Cell walls

25Cell structure
7.1.1 Concepts
Plasma Membrane
Phospholipid bilayer, which contains great amount of proteins, the most important functions
are the following:
1. It selectively isolates the content of the cell of the external atmosphere.
2. It regulates the interchange of substances between the cytoplasm and the environment.
3. Communicates with other cells.
Model of the ﬂuid mosaic
Describes the structure of the plasma membrane, this model was developed in 1972 by
cellular biologists J. Singer and L. Nicholson.
Phospholipid bilayer
Is in the plasma membrane and produces the ﬂuid part of membranes.
Proteins
Long chains of amino acids.
Glucose proteins
Proteins together with carbohydrates in the plasma membrane, mostly in the outer parts
of the cell.
Functions of proteins
Transport oxygen, they are components of hair and nails, and allow the cell interact with
its environment.
Transport Proteins
Regulate the movement of soluble water molecules, through the plasma membrane. Some
transport proteins called channel proteins form pores or channels in the membrane so
that water soluble molecules pass.
Carrying proteins
Have union sites that can hold speciﬁc molecules.
Reception proteins
They activate cellular responses when speciﬁc molecules join.
Proteins of recognition
They work as identiﬁers and as place of union to the cellular surface.
Fluid
It is any substance that can move or change of form.
Concentration
Number of molecules in a determined unit of volume.
26What is a cell?
Gradient
Physical diﬀerence between two regions of space, in such a way that the molecules tend to
move in response to the gradients.
Diﬀusion
Movement of the molecules in a ﬂuid, from the regions of high concentration to those of
low concentration.
Passive transport
Movement of substances in a membrane that doesn’t need to use energy.
Simple diﬀusion
Diﬀusion of water, gases or molecules across the membrane.
Facilitated diﬀusion
Diﬀusion of molecules across the membranes with the participation of proteins.
Osmosis
Diﬀusion of the water across a membrane with diﬀerential permeability.
Transport that needs energy
Movement of substances across a membrane generally in opposition to a gradient of
concentration with the requirement of energy.
Active transport
Movement of small molecules using energy (ATP).
Endocytosis
Movement of big particles towards the interior of the cell using energy. The cells enclose
particles or liquids.
Pinocytosis
(Literally cell drinking) Form in which the cell introduces liquids.
Phagocytosis
Way of eating of the cells. It feeds in this case of big particles or entire microorganisms.
Pseudopods
False feet (the amoeba).
Exocitosis
Movement of materials out of the cell with the use of energy. It throws waste material.
Isotonic
The cytoplasm ﬂuid of the interior of the cells is the same that the outer.
Hypertonic solution
27Cell structure
The solutions that have a higher concentration of dissolved particles than the cellular
cytoplasm and that therefore water of the cells goes out with osmosis.
Hypotonic
The solutions with a concentration of dissolved particles lower than the cytoplasm of a cell
and that therefore do that water enters the cell with osmosis.
Swelling
Pressure of the water inside the vacuole.
Endoplasmic Reticulum
It is the place of the synthesis of the cellular membrane.
7.1.2 Structure and function of the cell
Rudolf Virchow
Zoologist, who proposed the postulates of the cellular theory, observes that the living cells
could grow and be in two places at the same time, he proposed that all the cells come from
other equal cells and proposed 3 postulates:
1. Every living organism is formed from one or more cells
2. The smallest organisms are unicellular and these in turn are the functional units of
the multicellular organisms.
3. All the cells come from preexisting cells.
7.1.3 Common characteristics of all the cells
Molecular components
Proteins, amino acids, lipids, sweeten, DNA, RNA.
Structural components
Plasmatic membrane, citoplasm, ribosomes.
Robert Hooke
He postuled for the ﬁrst time the term cell
Prokaryotes
Their genetic material is not enclosed in a membrane ex. Bacterias
Eukaryotes
Their genetic material is contained inside a nucleus closed by a membrane
28History of cell knowledge
7.2 History of cell knowledge
The optical microscope was ﬁrst invented in 17th century. Shortly thereafter scientists began
to examine living and dead biological tissues in order to better understand the science of
life. Some of the most relevant discovery milestones of the time period include:
11
• The invention of the microscope , which allowed scientists for the ﬁrst time to see
biological cells
12
• Robert Hooke in 1665 looked at cork under a microscope and described what he called
cork "cells"
13
• Anton van Leeuwenhoek called the single-celled organisms that he saw under the
microscope "animalcules"
14
• Matthias Jakob Schleiden , a botanist, in 1838 determined that all plants consist of
cells
15
• Theodor Schwann , a zoologist, in 1839 determined that all animals consist of cells
16
• Rudolf Virchow proposed the theory that all cells arise from previously existing cells
In 1838, the botanist Matthias Jakob Schleiden and the physiologist Theodor Schwann
discovered that both plant cells and animal cells had nuclei. Based on their observations,
the two scientists conceived of the hypothesis that all living things were composed of cells.
In 1839, Schwann published 'Microscopic Investigations on the Accordance in the Structure
and Growth of Plants and Animals', which contained the ﬁrst statement of their joint cell
theory.
7.2.1 Cell Theory
Schleiden and Schwann proposed spontaneous generation as the method for cell origination,
17
but spontaneous generation (also called abiogenesis ) was later disproven. Rudolf Virchow
famously stated "Omnis cellula e cellula"... "All cells only arise from pre-existing cells." The
parts of the theory that did not have to do with the origin of cells, however, held up to
scientiﬁc scrutiny and are widely agreed upon by the scientiﬁc community today.
The generally accepted portions of the modern Cell Theory are as follows: (1) The cell is the
fundamental unit of structure and function in living things. (2) All organisms are made up
of one or more cells. (3) Cells arise from other cells through cellular division. (4) Cells carry
genetic material passed to daughter cells during cellular division. (5) All cells are essentially
the same in chemical composition. (6) Energy ﬂow (metabolism and biochemistry) occurs
within cells.

7.3 Microscopes
• Allow greater resolution, can see ﬁner detail
• Eye: resolution of ˜ 100 μm
18
• Light microscope : resolution of ˜ 200 nm
• Limited to cells are larger organelles within cells
19
• Confocal microscopy : 2 dimension view
20
• Electron microscope : resolution of ˜0.2 nm
• Laser tweezers: move cell contents
7.4 Cell size
One may wonder why all cells are so small. If being able to store nutrients is beneﬁcial
to the cell, how come there are no animals existing in nature with huge cells? Physical
limitations prevent this from occurring. A cell must be able to diﬀuse gases and nutrients in
and out of the cell. A cell's surface area does not increase as quickly as its volume, and as a
result a large cell may require more input of a substance or output of a substance than it
is reasonably able to perform. Worse, the distance between two points within the cell can
be large enough that regions of the cell would have trouble communicating, and it takes a
relatively long time for substances to travel across the cell.
That is not to say large cells don't exist. They are, once again, less eﬃcient at exchanging
materials within themselves and with their environment, but they are still functional. These
cells typically have more than one copy of their genetic information, so they can manufacture
proteins locally within diﬀerent parts of the cell.
Key concepts: Cell size:
• Is limited by need for regions of cell to communicate
• Diﬀuse oxygen and other gases
21 22
• Transport of mRNA and protein s
• Surface area to volume ratio limited
• Larger cells typically:
• Have extra copies of genetic information
• Have slower communication between parts of cell

308 Structure of Eukaryotic cells
1
Eukaryotic cells feature membrane delimited nucleii containing two or more linear chromo-
2 3 4
some s; numerous membrane-bound cytoplasmic organelles: mitochondria, RER , SER ,
5 6 7
lysosomes, vacuole s, chloroplast s; ribosomes and a cytoskeleton . Also, plants, fungi, and
some protists have a cell wall.
8.1 Structure of the nucleus
The nucleus is the round object in the cell that holds the genetic information (DNA) of the
cell. It is surrounded by a nuclear envelope and has a nucleolus inside.
8.1.1 Nuclear envelope
8
The nuclear envelope is a double-layered plasma membrane like the cell membrane, although
without membrane proteins. To allow some chemicals to enter the nucleus, the nuclear
9
envelope has structures called Nuclear pore s. The nuclear envelope is continuous with the
endoplasmic reticulum.
8.1.2 Nucleolus
The nucleolus appears in a microscope as a small dark area within the nucleus. The nucleolus
10
is the area where there is a high amount of DNA transcription taking place.

8.2 Chromatin
11
Chromosomes consist of chromatin . This is made up of strings of DNA, which typically
12
measure centimeters in length if stretched out. This DNA is wound around a histone core
13
and organized into nucleosome s.
14 15 16
The chromatin must be uncoiled for gene expression and replication . Chromosome
micrograph
8.3 Endoplasmic reticulum
17 18
The endoplasmic reticulum is a cellular organelle made up of a series of extended folded
intracellular membranes. It is continuous with the nuclear membane.
There are two main types of endoplasmic reticulum:
19
• RER: rough endoplasmic reticulum (site of protein synthesis ) associated with ribosomes
20
• SER: smooth endoplasmic reticulum (site of lipid synthesis )
8.3.1 Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum
21
Proteins are directed to the RER by a signal sequence of a growing polypeptide s on
the ribosome. This is recognised by a signal recognition particle which brings the ribo-
some/polypeptide complex to a channel on the RER called a translocon. At the translocon,
the signal sequence and ribosome/polypeptide complex interact with the translocon to open
it. The signal sequence becomes attached to the translocon. The ribosome can continue to
translate the polypeptide into the lumen of the RER. As synthesis continues, 2 processes
can happen.
1. If the protein is destined to become a membrane bound protein then the protein
synthesis will continue until termination. The ribosome can then dissociate, allowing
protein folding within the RER lumen to occur and continuation to the golgi apparatus
for processing of the polypeptide.
2. Iftheproteinisdestinedforstorageforlatersecretionafterstimulationorforcontinuous
secretion then a protease-enzyme which cuts proteins at the peptide bond-can cut the
signal sequence from the growing polypeptide. Continuation to the golgi etc. can then
occur.

32Endoplasmic reticulum
When produced, proteins are then exported to one of several locations. The proteins are
either modiﬁed for extracellular membrane insertion or secretion. Note, this is in contrast
with ribosomes which do not associate with the RER and produce proteins which will become
cytosolic enzymes for example.
8.3.2 Smooth Endoplasmic Reticulum
22
Smooth endoplasmic reticulum produces enzyme s for lipid and carbohydrate biosynthesis
and detoxiﬁcation RER
8.3.3 Sarcoplasmic Reticulum
This is a specialised form of endoplasmic reticulum found in some muscle cell types-
particularly striated, skeletal muscle. Its main function is diﬀerent from the other 2 types in
that is mainly acts as a storage of calcium. This reticulum has voltage gated channels which
respond to signals from 'motor neurones' to open and release calcium into the cytoplasm.
This can then bring about the next part in muscle contraction.

8.4 The Golgi apparatus
24
The golgi apparatus is made up of multiple stacks of bilipid membranes.
• Proteins made on the RER are modiﬁed and then sorted
• Formation of secretory vesicles
• Formation of lysosomes (intracellular digestion)
Other membrane-bound cytoplasmic organelles include:
25
• Microbodies (generic term)
• Glyoxysome (transforms fat into carbohydrate in plants)
26
• Peroxisome (uses oxidative metabolism to form hydrogen peroxide and is destroyed by
27
catalase )
8.5 Ribosomes
Ribosomes are the site of protein synthesis. Ribosomes themselves are synthesized in the
28
cell nucleoli and are structured as two subunits, the large and the small. These parts are
composed of RNA and protein.
Prokaryotic and eukaryotic ribosomes are diﬀerent, the eukaryotic ones being larger and
more complicated.
8.6 DNA-containing organelles
Mitochondria
• Double membrane
• Aerobic metabolism, internal membrane
• DNA, ribosomes
• Give rise to new mitochondria

• Microtubule organizing centers
• Animal cells and many protists
• Pair constitutes the centrosome
• Give rise to ﬂagellum during spermatogenesis
• Consist of 9 triplet microtubules
31 32
• Mitosis , meiosis
8.7 Cytoskeleton
Cytoskeleton is a collective term for diﬀerent ﬁlaments of proteins that can give physical
shape within the cell and are responsible for the 'roads' which organelles can be carried
along.
• Gives the cell shape
• Anchors other organelles
• Vital to intracellular transport of large molecules
The cytoskeleton is composed of 3 main types of ﬁlaments:
33
• Actin ﬁlaments (7 nm)
34
• Microtubule s: (25 nm) polymer of tubulin; 13/ring.
35
• Intermediate Filament s
Both actin and microtubules can have associated motor proteins.
8.7.1 Intermediate Filaments
These are rope like ﬁlaments, 8-10nm in diameter and tend to give the structural stability to
cells. Examples inculude Vimentin, neuroﬁlaments and keratin. It is keratin which priniciply
makes up hair, nails and horns.
8.7.2 Actin Filaments
Growth
These ﬁlaments are 2-stranded and composed of dimeric subunits called G-Actin. They
contain a GTP molecule in order to bind (polymerise). As GTP is hydrolysed then the
structure becomes unstable and depolymerisation occurs. The growth of actin ﬁlaments is
concentration dependant-that is, the higher the concentration of free G-actin, the greater
the polymerisation. The are also polar, having a + and a - end (not related to charge) and

6 CO + 6 H O→ C H O + 6 O
2 2 6 12 6 2
• One of most important reactions in history of life:
• source of atmospheric O
2
• ultimately led to aerobic respiration and eukaryotes
• Responsible for bulk of glucose production
• Early experiments showed that mass of plant must be derived from substances in the air,
not the soil
• Experiments with isotopes showed that liberated oxygen comes from water
• Experiments also showed that light is essential but that some reactions (e.g., reduction of
CO ) continue in the dark
2
• Plants do two big, important things during photosynthesis: gain energy (absorb light)
and build sugar (glucose).
• Photosynthesis can be divided into two series of chemical reactions: the light (light-
dependent) reactions and the dark (light-independent) reactions. In light reactions, light
is absorbed; in dark reactions, sugar is built.
• Occurs when plants, algae, and autotrophic bacteria absorb light energy and build glucose.
13.1 Light Reactions
• Part of the electromagnetic spectrum
• Consists of units of energy called photons
• Photons at UV end of spectrum have more energy than those at the red end
• Occur on the surface of thylakoid disks
• Chlorophyll and other plant pigments diﬀerentially absorb photons
• Chlorophyll a: light to chemical energy
• Chlorophyll b: accessory chlorophyll
• Chlorophylls absorb primarily blue and red (green reﬂected back, hence the green
color of plants)
13.1.1 Accessory pigments
• Chlorophyll is a major light gathering pigment
• Absorbs light with considerable eﬃciency (i.e., retaining energy)
• Accessory pigments
• Chlorophyll b
• Carotenoinds
• capture light of wavelengths not captured by chlorophylls
51Photosynthesis
• Confer other colors to plant leaves (autumn colors too)
Photosynthetic steps
• Primary photoevent: light photon captured by photosystem and energy transferred to
electron donated by water
• Electron transport: excited electron is shuttled along imbedded series of electron carriers
to proton pump and electron is transferred to acceptor
• Chemiosmosis: transport of protons back into chloroplast drives synthesis of ATP
13.1.2 The Even More Detailed Light Reactions
What the Light Reactions Do:
The light reactions of photosynthesis occur in chloroplasts in and on the thylakoid disks.
During the light reactions, light energy charges up ATP molecules. More speciﬁcally, light
turns the chloroplast into an acid battery, and this battery charges up ATP.
How the "Chloroplast-Battery" Charges ATP:
The stroma is the ﬂuid inside of the chloroplasts, and it carries a negative charge. This
means that it contains about a "gazillion" extra electrons. The solvent of stroma is water.
The ﬂuid inside the thylakoid disks is positively charged because it contains a lot of hydrogen
(H+) ions. The pH here is low, making the ﬂuid very acidic. The solvent of thylakoid disk
ﬂuid is water.
A chloroplast acts like a battery, because it has separated a strong positive charge and a
strong negative charge in two diﬀerent compartments. Energy is released when H+ ions
(free protons) ﬂow from the inside of a thylakoid disk to the stroma. This is electrical energy,
since it is a ﬂow of charged particles.
The protons pass through special channels (made of protein) in the thylakoid membrane;
this reaction is 'exothermic.' The energy that is given oﬀ is used to fuel this reaction (Pi is
the phosphate ion):
ADP + Pi --> ATP
The proton can go to the negative stroma, but only if it uses its energy to charge up ATP.
Since one reaction wants to go, and the other one doesn't, and since the ﬁrst reaction releases
energy and the second one absorbs energy, the two reactions are known to be 'coupled'
together so that the ﬁrst fuels the second. Of course, a special enzyme must be involved for
this to happen.
Chlorophyll Molecules on a Thylakoid Disk:
Hundreds of chlorophyll molecules cover the surface of a thylakoid disk, making the disk
green. The nonpolar "tails" of the chlorophyll molecule are embedded in the membrane of
the thylakoid.
52“Dark” reactions
13.2 “Dark” reactions
• ATP drives endergonic reactions
• NADPH provides hydrogens for reduction of CO to carbohydrate (C-H bonds)
2
• Occur in the stroma
• First step in carbon ﬁxation
13.2.1 The Detailed Dark Reactions
What the Dark Reactions Do:
The dark reactions build sugar from carbon dioxide gas (CO2), water (H2O), and energy
from ATP molecules that were charged up during the light reactions. The dark reactions
occur in the stroma of a chloroplast. Dark reactions usually occur in the light, but they
don't have to. They'll occur in the dark until the chloroplast's supply of ATP runs out
(usually about 30 seconds).
The Calvin Cycle:
The Calvin Cycle is the fancy name for the metabolic pathway that builds sugar. This
means that it involves a whole lot of chemical reactions, and it uses a lot of diﬀerent enzymes
to catalyze the reactions.
Carbon dioxide gas is stable, therefore the bonds that hold the carbon and oxygen atoms
are strong. Therefore it takes a lot of energy to break the bonds and separate the carbon
atoms from the oxygen atoms. The energy needed to do this comes from ATP molecules.
When inorganic carbon (like from CO2) is being added to an organic molecule (such as
sugar), this is called carbon ﬁxation.
It takes 2 complete turns of the Calvin Cycle to make a glucose molecule.

6115 Genetics
6316 Gregor Mendel and biological
inheritance
1
Charles Darwin , for all he contributed to the science of biology, never knew about the
mechanism by which living things inherit traits from previous generations, or how new traits
arise.
As any schoolchild can tell you, this mechanism of interitance has since been found to be
2
DNA , or deoxyribonucleic acid. DNA allows for stable inheritance of traits: the code in
each strand of DNA is replicated precisely through the pairing of basic units along each
strand. The error rate in this replication is amazingly low; not even one base pair in a
million matches out of sequence.
However, when even one base pair is added to a new strain of DNA in an order diﬀerently
than in the parent chain, it can be the basis of amutation. These changes in DNA sequences
are the microscopic origin of changes in traits of all studied living things. Even the smallest
diﬀerence in a strand of DNA can result in a change in traits that can cost the life of the
organism. Mutations can produce proteins with a new or altered function. In humans, the
3
example of Sickle cell anemia is commonly given as its origin is a diﬀerence of only one
base pair in a section of DNA that encodes red blood cells.
Individual sequences of DNA that encode for speciﬁc proteins are called genes and are the

units of heredity. Each one has a set nucleotide , and together all of the genes (and some
sequence of DNA that apparently do not code for any biologically important functions)
5
together make up the entire chromosome
16.1 Mendel
• Discovered principle of genetic segregation via numerous experiments utilizing pea plants
• Inferred the existence of genes through segregation of phenotypes
• Used quantitative methods: counted; ratios
• Work is model of scientiﬁc method
• In particular, observed the F2 progeny, which lead to the discovery of dominant and
recessive traits
• Published work in 1866, went unnoticed
• In 1900 his scientiﬁc paper was “rediscovered”

65Gregor Mendel and biological inheritance
• Mendel is acknowledged as founder of Genetics
• still used alphabet letters to designate genes
• still refer to dominant and recessive genes
• still refer to segregation of alleles in meiosis
• principle of segregation applies to all sexually reproducing organisms; Mendel’s results
were immediately applied to humans in 1900
16.2 Mendel’s experiments
• 1856, began experiments with the garden pea, Pisum sativum
• 1865, presented results to the Bruno natural history society, which he helped found
• 1866, published his results in proceedings of the society
• Naegeli encouraged Mendel to reproduce results in another species, which failed because
the species did not undergo true fertilization
• discrete traits in Pisum sativum
• pure-breeding lines
• dominant/recessive alleles
• alleles are two alternate versions of a gene
• gametes contain hybridized chromosomes that are formed during meiosis
• homozygous has two of the same allele
• heterozygous has two diﬀerent alleles
• reciprocal F1 crosses (all exhibiting dominant phenotypes); F2; F3
• counted oﬀspring, noted ratios
• inferred genotypes from phenotypes
• tested hypotheses with testcrosses
• attempted to repeat with another species
16.3 Mendel’s seven pairs of traits
1. Seed form (round or wrinkled)
2. Cotyledon color (green or yellow)
3. Seed coat color (white or colored)
4. Pod form (inﬂated or constricted)
5. Pod color (green or yellow)
6. Flower position (axial or terminal)
7. Plant heights (tall or short)
16.4 Locus
• The location of a speciﬁc gene within a chromosome
66Modern Y chromosome
16.5 Modern Y chromosome
Y-chromosome is the most evolved chromosome. Generally it is thought that if Y- chro-
mosome is present in an individual then he will be male. But if mutation occurs at sex
determining region or zinc factor then it will not code for testis determining factor, and
results in normal female. This type of female's frequency is 1/250000.
16.6 Chromosome phenomena
• X-chromosome inactivation
• Barr bodies
• Nondisjunction: failure of chromosome segregation at meiosis or mitosis
• Results in 2N± 1 chromosome number
• Trisomy 2N + 1
• Usually lethal. Trisomy 21 (Down) exception
• Monosomy 2N ** 1
• Lethal except XO
• Usually maternal origin in humans
16.7 X-chromosome inactivation
In females, one X-chromosone is randomly switched oﬀ forming a Barr body.
16.8 Barr body
Dense region in the nucleus formed by the inactive X-chromosome.
16.9 Human genetic disorders
Down's Syndrome(Mongolism)
Down's Syndrome is usually produced by the nondisjunction of chromosome 21 during
oogenesis and sometimes during spermatogenesis. The individual suﬀering from this type of
syndrome has 47 chromosomes instead of the normal 46. The extra chromosome is not a sex
chromosome but an autosome.
Most cases of mongolism were found to occur in children born by women in their forties.
The aﬀected children, called mongoloids, show mental retardation and have a shorter life
expectancy. Their most prominent feature is the Mongolian folds in their eyes; hence, the
term mongolism.
Klinefelter's Syndrome
67Gregor Mendel and biological inheritance
When an XY-bearing sperm unites with an X-bearing egg, the resulting condition is called
Klinefelter's Syndrome, or sexually undeveloped male. Individuals having the syndrome
show the following characteristics:
• testes are small
• sperms are never produced
• breasts are enlarged
• body hair is sparse
• individuals are mentally defective
The same abnormal meiotic division may occur in females. They produce eggs with XX or
no sex chromosomes. Such egg, when fertilized by a Y-bearing sperm, will not develop (YO).
This is because YO is lethal--it wil cause death to the oﬀspring.
6817 DNA: The Genetic Material
17.1 DNA
DNA stands for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid. That is, a nucleic acid with two sugars. DNA is
the hereditary material of cells and is considered the blueprint of life. DNA is found in all
kingdoms of life. Even most viruses have DNA. A molecule of DNA is chemically stable (it
does not have a 2-prime alcohol group.)
When someone says DNA, they may be referring to one's genetic material on multiple levels:
They may be speaking about a single deoxyribose nucleic acid molecule, a section of a double
helix, a section of a chromosome, or one's entire hereditary composition.
• antiparallel
• Double helix
• Semiconservative replication
• Sequence of nucleotides encodes functional RNA or polypeptide
17.2 Historical perspective
• Mitosis and meiosis
• Regular distribution of chromosomes suggested that they contain hereditary informa-
tion
• Bridges/Morgan, usingDrosophilamelanogastershowedthatgenesareonchromosomes
(1910s)
• Hammerling: nucleus contains hereditary information (1930s)
• Griﬃth: transformation of bacteria (1928)
• Avery, MacLeod, McCarty: transforming substance is DNA (1944)
• Hershey, Chase: DNA is hereditary material of viruses (1952)
• Rosalind Franklin
• Watson and Crick: structure of DNA (1953)
17.3 Hershey-Chase Experiment
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading suggestions that DNA was a
genetic material. Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA
into a bacterium. They did two experiments marking either the DNA in the phage with
a radioactive phophorus or the protein of the phage with radioactive sulfur. With the
bacteria that was infected by the phages with radioactive DNA the DNA in the bacteria
69DNA: The Genetic Material
was radioactive. In the bacteria that was infected with the radioactive protein the bacteria
was radioactive, not the DNA. This proves that DNA is a genetic material and it is passed
on in viruses.
17.4 DNA/RNA components
• Miescher: discovered DNA, 1869
17.4.1 Structure of DNA
DNA is in a double helix structure made up of nucleotides. The "backbone" of the double
helix is composed of phosphates connected to a ﬁve carbon sugar called deoxyribose, . The
"rungs" are composed of nitrogenous bases, Purines and Pyrimidines. Purines contain
Adenine(A) and Guanine(G) and have two rings in their structures. Pyrimidines contain
Cytosine(C) and Thymine (T) and have one ring in their structures.

8020 Mutation
1
A mutation is a permanent change to an organism's genetic material (DNA or RNA).
Mutations are a rare but signiﬁcant biological process, since they provide the variation on
2
which evolution acts and are also the source of cancer.
3
An organism's genetic material is made up of polymers (chains) of four diﬀerent nucleotides ,
like a recipe book written in a language of only four letters. A mutation event is when the
order of the nucleotides in DNA change, usually when the DNA is being copied.
Mutations come in a number of forms:
20.1 Point Mutations
Point mutations are all mutations which involve a single nucleotide. These come in the form
of substitutions, insertions and deletions:
20.2 Substitution
Substitution Mutations: In substitution mutations, a nitrogenous base of a triplet codon of
DNA is replaced by another nitrogen base or some derivative of the nitrogen base, changing
the codon. The altered codon codes for a diﬀerent amino acid substitution.The substitution
mutations are of two types:
1.Transitions: It is the replacement of one purine in a polynucleotide chain by another
purine(A by G or C by A) or one pyrimidine by another pyrimidine(T by C or C by T)
2.Transversions:A base pair substitution involving the substitution of a purine by pyrimidine
or pyrimidine by a purine is called transversion.

particularly rare:
20.4.1 Translocation
20.4.2 Fusion
20.4.3 Fission
20.4.4 Segmental Duplication
20.4.5 Chromosomal Duplication
20.4.6 Genome Duplication
20.5 Causes of mutations
20.6 Eﬀects of mutations
Mutations can have a variety of diﬀerent eﬀects depending on the type of mutation, the
signiﬁcance of the piece of genetic material aﬀected and whether the cells aﬀected are germ-
82Further reading
line cells. Only mutations in germ-line cells can be passed on to children, while mutations
elsewhere can cause cell-death or cancer.
Mutations can be classiﬁed by their eﬀects:
20.6.1 Silent Mutation
Silent Mutations are DNA mutations that do not result in a change to the amino acid
sequence or a protein. They may occur in a non-coding region (outside of a gene or within
an intron), or they may occur within an exon in a manner that does not alter the ﬁnal
amino acid chain.
20.6.2 Frameshift
20.6.3 Missense Mutation
Missense mutations are types of point mutations where a single nucleotide is changed to
cause substitution of a diﬀerent amino acid. This in turn can render the resulting protein
nonfunctional. Such mutations are responsible for diseases such as Epidermolysis bullosa.

9122 Classiﬁcation of Living Things
22.0.1 Classiﬁcation of Living Things & Naming
With so many ﬂora and fauna on planet Earth, there must be a method to classify each
organism to distinguish it from others so it can be correctly identiﬁed. Classiﬁcation does
not only apply to biology. For example, supermarkets and grocery stores organise their
products by classifying them. Beverages may occupy one aisle, while cleaning supplies may
occupy another. In science, the practice of classifying organisms is called taxonomy (Taxis
means arrangement and nomos means law). The modern taxonomic system was developed
by the Swedish botanist Carolus (Carl) Linneaeus (1707-1788). He used simple physical
characteristics of organisms to identify and diﬀerentiate between diﬀerent species.
Linneaeus developed a hierarchy of groups for taxonomy. To distinguish diﬀerent levels of
similarity, each classifying group, called taxon (pl. taxa) is subdivided into other groups.
To remember the order, it is helpful to use a mnemonic device. The taxa in hierarchical
order:
• Domain - Archea, Eubacteria, Eukaryote
• Kingdom - Plants, Animals, Fungi, Protists, Eubacteria (Monera), Archaebacteria
• Phylum
• Class
• Order
• Family
• Genus
• Species
The domain is the broadest category, while species is the most speciﬁc category available.
The taxon Domain was only introduced in 1990 by Carl Woese, as scientists reorganise
things based on new discoveries and information. For example, the European Hare would
be classiﬁed as follows:
Eukaryote --> Animal --> Chordata --> Mammalia --> Lagomorpha --> Leporidae -->
Lepus --> Lepus europaeus.
Binomial nomenclature is used to name an organism, where the ﬁrst word beginning
with a capital is the genus of the organism and the second word beginning with lower-case
letter is the species of the organism. The name must be in italics and in Latin, which was
the major language of arts and sciences in the 18th century. The scientiﬁc name can be also
abbreviated, where the genus is shortened to only its ﬁrst letter followed by a period. In our
example, Lepus europaeus would become L. europaeus'.
Taxonomy and binomial nomenclature are both speciﬁc methods of classifying an organism.
They help to eliminate problems, such as mistaken identity and false assumptions, caused
by common names. An example of the former is the fact that a North American robin is
93Classiﬁcation of Living Things
quite diﬀerent from the English robin. An example of the latter is the comparison between
crayﬁsh and catﬁsh, where one might believe that they both are ﬁsh when in fact, they are
quite diﬀerent.
Nomenclature is concerned with the assignment of names to taxonomic groups in agreement
with published rules.
22.0.2 Eukaryotes & Prokaryotes
Recall that there are two basic types of cells: eukaryotes and prokaryotes.
Eukaryotes are more complex in structure, with nuclei and membrane-bound organelles.
Some characteristics of eukaryotes are:
• Large (100 - 1000 μm)
• DNA in nucleus, bounded by membrane
• Genome consists of several chromosomes.
• Sexual reproduction common, by mitosis and meiosis
• Mitochondria and other organelles present
• Most forms are multicellular
• Aerobic
Prokaryotes refer to the smallest and simplest type of cells, without a true nucleus and no
membrane-bound organelles. Bacteria fall under this category. Some characteristics:
• Small (1-10 μm)
• DNA circular, unbounded
• Genome consists of single chromosome.
• Asexual reproduction common, not by mitosis or meiosis.
• No general organelles
• Most forms are singular
• Anaerobic
22.0.3 The Three Domains
The three domains are organised based on the diﬀerence between eukaryotes and prokaryotes.
Today's living prokaryotes are extremely diverse and diﬀerent from eukaryotes. This fact has
been proven by molecular biological studies (e.g. of RNA structure) with modern technology.
The three domains are as follows:
Archea (Archeabacteria) consists of archeabacteria, bacteria which live in extreme
environments. The kingdom Archaea belongs to this domain.
Eubacteriaconsistsofmoretypicalbacteriafoundineverydaylife. ThekingdomEubacteria
belongs to this domain.
Eukaryote encompasses most of the world's visible living things. The kingdoms Protista,
Fungi, Plantae, and Animalia fall under this category.
94Stem cells
22.0.4 The Six Kingdoms
Under the three domains are six kingdoms in taxonomy. The ﬁrst two, Plants andAnimals,
are commonly understood and will not be expounded here.
Protista, the third kingdom, was introduced by the German biologist Ernst Haeckel in
1866 to classify micro-organisms which are neither animals nor plants. Since protists are
quite irregular, this kingdom is the least understood and the genetic similarities between
organisms in this kingdom are largely unknown. For example, some protists can exhibit
properties of both animals and plants.
Fungi are organisms which obtain food by absorbing materials in their bodies. Mushrooms
and moulds belong in this kingdom. Originally, they were part of the plant kingdom but
were recategorised when they were discovered not to photosynthesise.
Eubacteria are bacteria, made up of small cells, which diﬀer in appearance from the
organisms in the above kingdoms. They lack a nucleus and cell organelles. They have cell
walls made of peptidoglycan.
Archae (or Archaebacteria) are bacteria which live in extreme environments, such as
salt lakes or hot, acidic springs. These bacteria are in their own category as detailed studies
have shown that they have unique properties and features (ex. unusual lipids that are not
found in any other organism)which diﬀer them from other bacteria and which allow them to
live where they live. Their cell walls lack peptidoglycan.
22.0.5 Origins of Diversity
The diversity in our planet is attributed to diversity within a species. As the world changed
in climate and in geography as time passed, the characteristics of species diverged so much
that new species were formed. This process, by which new species evolve, was ﬁrst described
by British naturalist Charles Darwin as natural selection.
For an organism to change, genetic mutations must occur. At times, genetic mutations are
accidental, as in the case of prokaryotes when they undergo asexual reproduction. For most
eukaryotes, genetic mutations occur through sexual reproduction, where meiosis produces
haploid gametes from the original parent cells. The fusion of these haploid gametes into
a diploid zygote results in genetic variation in each generation. Over time, with enough
arrangement of genes and traits, new species are produced. Sexual reproduction creates an
immense potential of genetic variety.
One goal of taxonomy is to determine the evolutionary history of organisms. This can be
achieved by comparing species living today with species in the past. The comparison in
anatomy and structure is based on data from development, physical anatomy, biochemistry,
DNA, behaviour, and ecological preferences. The following are examples of how such data is
used:
• Anatomy:
Although a horse and a human may look diﬀerent, there is evidence that their arm structures
are quite similar. Their arms' sizes and proportions may be diﬀerent, but the anatomical
structures are quite similar. Such evidence reveals that animals in diﬀerent taxa may not
95Classiﬁcation of Living Things
be that diﬀerent. Biological features from a common evolutionary origin are known as
homologous.
• Development
• Biochemistry:
Biochemical analysis of animals similar in appearance have yielded surprising results. For
example, although guinea pigs were once considered to be rodents, like mice, biochemistry
led them to be in their taxon of their own.
22.0.6 Phylogeny, Cladistics & Cladogram
Modern taxonomy is based on many hypotheses' of the evolutionary history of organisms,
known as phylogeny. As with the Scientiﬁc Method, scientists develop a hypothesis on the
history of an animal and utilise modern science and technology to prove the phylogeny.
Cladistics is a classiﬁcation system which is based on phylogeny. Expanding on phylogeny,
cladistics is based on the assumption that each group of related species has one common
ancestor and would therefore retain some ancestral characteristics. Moreover, as these
related species evolve and diverge from their common ancestor, they would develop unique
characteristics. Such characteristics are known as derived characteristics
The principles of phylogeny and cladistics can be expressed visually as a cladogram,
a branching diagram which acts as a family (phylogenetic) tree for similar species. A
cladogram can also be used to test alternative hypotheses for an animal's phylogeny. In
order to determine the most likely cladogram, the derived characteristics of similar species
are matched and analysed.

22.1 Introduction
Viruses are the smallest biological particle (the tiniest are only 20 nm in diameter). However,
they are not biological organisms so they are not classiﬁed in any kingdom of living things.
They do not have any organelles and cannot respire or perform metabolic functions. Viruses
are merely strands of DNA or RNA surrounded by a protective protein coat called a capsid.
Viruses only come to life when they have invaded a cell. Outside of a host cell, viruses are
completely inert.
Since ﬁrst being identiﬁed in 1935, viruses have been classiﬁed into more than 160 major
groups. Viruses are classiﬁed based on their shape, replication properties, and the diseases
that they cause. Furthermore, the shape of a virus is determined by the type and arrangement
of proteins in its capsid. Viruses pathogenic to humans are currently classiﬁed into 21 groups.
Viruses can also attack bacteria and infect bacterial cells. Such viruses are called bacterio-
phages.
97Classiﬁcation of Living Things
22.2 Viral Replication
As previously stated, viruses are not a biological life form so they cannot reproduce by
themselves. They need to take over a functioning eukaryotic or prokaryotic cell to replicate
its DNA or RNA and to make protein coat for new virus particles.
In order to enter a cell, a virus must attach to a speciﬁc receptor site on the plasma membrane
of the host cell. The proteins on the surface of the virus act as keys which ﬁt exactly into a
matching glycoprotein on the host cell membrane. In some viruses, the attachment protein
is not on the surface of the virus but is in the capsid or in the envelope.
There are two forms of viral replication: the lytic cycle and the lysogenic cycle.
22.2.1 Lytic Cycle
1. Attachment: The virus binds to speciﬁc receptors on the host cell.
2. Entry: There are two ways in which a virus can enter cells. Firstly, the virus can inject
its nucleic acid into the host cell. Secondly, if a virus is contained in an envelope, the
host cell can phagocytosise the entire virus particle into a vacuole. When the virus
breaks out of the vacuole, it then releases its nucleic acid into the cell.
3. Replication: The virus's nucleic acid instructs the host cell to replicate the virus's
DNA or RNA.
4. Assembly: New virus particles are assembled.
5. Lysis and Release: The virus directs the production of an enzyme which damages
the host cell wall, causing the host cell to swell and burst. The newly formed virus
particles are now released.
22.2.2 Lysogenic Cycle
1. Attachment: Similar to Lytic Cycle
2. Entry: Similar to Lytic Cycle
3. Incorporation: The viral nucleic acids is not replicated, but instead integrated by
genetic combination (crossing over) into the host cell's chromosome. When integrated
in a host cell this way, the viral nucleic acid as part of the host cell's chromosome is
known as a prophage.
4. Host Cell Reproduction: The host cell reproduces normally. Subsequent cell divisions,
daughter cells, contain original father cell's chromosome embedded with a prophage.
5. Cycle Induction: Certain factors now determine whether the daughter cell undergoes
the lytic or lysogenic cycle. At any time, a cell undergoing the lysogenic cycle can
switch to the lytic cycle.
The reproduction cycle of viruses with RNA and no DNA is slightly diﬀerent. A notable
example of a RNA-based virus is HIV, a retrovirus.
98Viral Genome
Retrovirus reproductive cycle
1. The retrovirus force RNA into cell, by either one of the two methods of entry (See
above).
2. In the retrovirus are reverse transcriptase enzymes, which catalyses the synthesis of a
DNA strand complementary to the viral RNA.
3. Reverse transcriptase catalyses a second DNA strand complementary to the ﬁrst. With
these two strands, the double-stranded DNA can be created.
4. DNA is then incorporated into the host cell's chromosomes. Similar to the concept of
a prophage, this incorporated DNA is called a provirus. However, the provirus never
leaves the host cell, unlike a prophage.
5. The infected host cell undergoes the lytic or lysogenic cycle.
22.3 Viral Genome
The genome of a virus consists of DNA or RNA, whose size and conﬁguration vary. The
entire genome can exist as a single nucleic acid molecule or several nucleic acid segments.
Also, the DNA or RNA may be single-stranded or double-stranded, and either linear or
circular.
Not all viruses can reproduce in a host cell by themselves. Since viruses are so small, the
size of their genome is limiting. For example, some viruses have coded instructions for only
making a few diﬀerent proteins for the viruses' capsid. On the other hand, the human
genome codes for over 30,000 diﬀerent proteins. Therefore, the lack of coded instructions
cause some viruses to need the presence of other viruses to help them reproduce themselves.
Such viruses are called replication defective.
Lastly, it is worthy to note that 70% of all viruses are RNA viruses. As the process of RNA
replication (with enzymes and other organelles of the host cell) is more prone to errors, RNA
viruses have much higher mutation rates than do DNA viruses.
22.4 Viruses Practice Questions
1. As the name implies, the Tomato Spotted Wilt Virus targets tomatoes. Would it be
possible for this virus to target other fruits as well? Explain.
2. If a DNA and a RNA virus both infected somatic cells, which virus would be more
diﬃcult to detect?
3. Many people have had cold sores, which are caused by infection with the herpes
simplex virus. One characteristic of cold sores is that after a period of inactivity, they
will reappear many times during the course of a person's life. Which cycle would the
herpes simplex virus undergo?
4. Chicken pox is a common, non-fatal disease usually acquired in adolescence and caused
by the varicella zoster virus. In adulthood, many people suﬀer from shingles, an altered
form of the varicella zoster virus. Which cycle would the varicella zoster virus have
undergone?
5. Would an antibiotic work for a person suﬀering from a cold of ﬂu? Explain.

100Domains of life: characteristics
22.7 Domains of life: characteristics
This text is based on notes very generously donated by Paul Doerder, Ph.D., of the Cleveland
State University.
22.8 Introduction
Out of the six kingdoms, Protista is the most diverse. This is the kingdom of organisms
with strange, atypical characteristics. In essence, this kingdom is designated for organisms
which do not belong in any other kingdom. The majority of protists are microscopic.
22.9 Classiﬁcation of Protists
There are three phyla of protists, based on their type of nutrition.
1. Protozoa (animal-like protists) are heterotrophs that ingest or absorb their food.
2. Algae (plant-like protists) are autotrophs they get nutrition from photosythesis.
3. Slime moulds and water moulds (fungus-like protists) are also heterotrophs, like
protozoa.
22.10 Protozoa
As heterotrophs, protozoa scavenge materials from their surroundings. Others are predators
which actively hunt or ambush small organisms such as bacteria and other protozoa for a
source of nutrition. Protozoa can be parasitic as well; they may live inside larger organisms,
like humans. Most protozoa live as single cells, although a few form colonies.
Protozoa are generally diﬃcult to identify due to their varied shape. They may appear as
jelly-like blobs, spherical sunbursts, or a ﬂattened leaf. Tiny blood parasites may be only 2
μm long. On the other hand, shell-covered marine may be 5 cm or more in diameter.
Furthermore, diﬀerent protozoans have their own complex life cycles. The complexity has
led certain organisms to be mistakenly classiﬁed for other species.
Nevertheless, protozoa can move, and so, they are classiﬁed based on their methods of
locomotion.
Characteristics of Protozoa :
• About 30,000 species known
• About 10,000 species are pathogenic, including some of the worst human diseases
• heterotrophic
• highly variable in form and life cycle
101Classiﬁcation of Living Things
• mostly unicellular
• range in size from 0.005 mm to 50 mm
• lack cell walls
they love environment and each other..............
22.11 Algae
Algae are much simpler than protozoa. They are aquatic and contain chlorophyll. Algae can
exist as a single cell or as giant seaweeds 60 m in length. Formerly, algae were classiﬁed as
plants but this was incorrect as algae lack parts of true plants: leaves, stems, roots, xylem,
and phloem. Since algae belong in the kingdom Protista, algae is a broad term used to
denote all aquatic eukaryotes which photosynthesise; algae can diﬀer in size and shape as
well.
There are six phyla of algae:chlorophytes (green algae), phaeophytes (brown algae),
rhodophytes (red algae), chrysophytes (diatoms), pyrrophytes (dinoﬂagellates),
and euglenophytes (euglenoids).
22.11.1 Chlorophytes
Chlorophytes resemble plants the most. Like plants, their cell walls contain cellulose and
they store food in reserve as starch. Chlorophytes can be unicellular or multicellular. Most
chlorophytes use ﬂagellae for some locomotion.
22.11.2 Phaeophytes
Phaeophytes are nearly all multicellular marine organisms, which are known to us as seaweeds.
They have cell walls composed of cellulose and alginic acid (a substance similar to pectin).
The cellulose and alignic acid help to retain water and prevent seawood from drying out
when exposed to air at low tide.
Since phaeophytes live in a tidal environment, they have large, ﬂat fronds (a large leaf)
which can withstand pounding by waves. Their bases strongly anchor the algae to the rocky
seabed and prevent them from being washed out to sea. Phaeophytes are usually found in
areas of cold water.
22.11.3 Rhodophytes
Rhodophytes are typically found in warmer seawater, and are more delicate and smaller
than brown algae (phaeophytes). Rhodophytes are also able to grow at deeper depths in
the ocean, since red algae absorb green, violet, and blue light, the wavelengths of which
penetrate the deepest below the water surface. They also have mucilaginous material to
resist drying.
102Slime molds & Water molds
22.11.4 Chryosophytes
Chryosophytes are the most abundant unicellular algae in the oceans. They are also one
of the biggest components of plankton, a free-ﬂoating collection of microorganisms, eggs,
and larvae. As photosynthetic organisms, they produce a signiﬁcant amount of atmospheric
oxygen.
The reproduction cycle of chryosophytes is particularly interesting. Note that diatoms
reproduce both asexually and sexually. Since diatoms have a rigid cell wall with an outer
layer of silica (found in sand and glass), the daughter cells produced by mitosis must ﬁt
inside the original cell wall. Therefore, each generation of diatoms is smaller than the one
before. The reduction in size continues until the diatoms produce sexually, producing a
zygote which eventually grows to the original size as it matures.
22.11.5 Pyrrophytes
Pyrrophytes are unicellular, photosynthetic, and mostly aquatic. They have protective coats
composed of stiﬀ cellulose. They are more easily identiﬁable, due to the presence of two
ﬂagellae. The longer ﬂagellae propels the dinoﬂagellate, while the second shorter, ﬂatter
ﬂagellae functions as a rudder.
Some species of pyrrophytes are zooxanthellae. Since they lack cellulose plates, they make
their home in coral reefs and animals, such as sea anemones, and molluscs. In returning
the favour of sheltering them, dinoﬂagellates provide carbohydrates to their host through
photosynthesis. This is why there are nutrient-rich coral reefs in malnutritions water.
A negative aspect of pyrrophytes is that under certain conditions, species of dinoﬂagellates
reproduce rapidly to form a harmful algal bloom (HAB), known as a red tide if dinoﬂag-
ellates are the cause. Such pyrrophytes can produce toxins which may injure or kill wildlife,
and additionally any consumers of contaminated wildlife.
22.11.6 Euglenophytes
Like pyrrophytes, euglenophytes are small unicellular freshwater organisms with two ﬂagella.
They are mainly autotrophic or heterotrophic, depending if they have a red, light-sensitive
structure called an eyespot.
22.12 Slime molds & Water molds
There are two phyla of slime moulds and one phylum of water moulds.
22.12.1 Oomycotes (Water moulds)
Oomycotes are ﬁlamentous organisms which resemble fungi, in that they live as saprotrophs.
Oomycotes diﬀer from other moulds with the presence of spores and their sexual life cycle.
103Classiﬁcation of Living Things
22.12.2 Myxomycotes (Plasmodial slime moulds)
Myxomycotiesarevisibletothenakedeyeastinyslug-likeorganismswhichcreepoverdecayed
and dead matter. This streaming blob containing many nuclei is called a plasmodium.
22.12.3 Acrasiomycotes (Cellular slime moulds) and its reproductive
cycle
Acrasiomycotes exist as individual amoeboid cells with one nucleus each. When in un-
favourable conditions, each acrasiomycete cell gathers together to form a pseudoplasmod-
ium.
Reproductive Cycle:
1. One acrasiomycete cell joins with others to form a pseudoplasmodium.
2. The pseudoplasmodium shrinks and forms a smaller plasmodium.
3. The plasmodium migrates to a suitable environment.
4. The plasmodium develops a sporangia, where original parental nuclei has divided by
meiosis into haploid spores to be germinated.
5. When favourable conditions arise, the spores germinate and are carried away by animals
or the wind.
6. Cycle repeats.

23.23 Introduction
Although you may not recognise fungi, they are just as prevalent as plants and animals.
Their spores are in the air which we breathe, fungi allow us to make bread, and mushrooms
(a type of fungi) are eaten by us. A few types of fungi are unicellular. For example, yeasts live
as individual oval or cylindrical cells. However, the majority of fungi live are multicellular.
Their bodies are composed of hyphae, a network of ﬁne ﬁlaments. In a mushroom, the
111Multicellular Photosynthetic Autotrophs
hyphae are densely packed so it is diﬃcult to see the individual structures when a mushroom
is eaten. However, a mushroom is only a specialised reproductive part of the whole fungus.
The main part of the fungi is underground in a whole web of hyphae, called a mycelium.
In the mycelium, each fungal cell is separated from each other by a septum. Each fungal
cell may have one or more nuclei and remains connected to the mycelium because the septa
are porous, allowing cytoplasm to ﬂow through the hyphae and fungal cell walls, made of a
hard material called chitin. Some fungi do not have septa, and they appear to be large,
branching, multinucleate cells.
23.24 Nutrition
Fungi are saprophytes. When they ﬁnd a source of food (e.g. dead wood, orange peel) ,
they decompose it and digest it. The enzymes break down larger organic molecules in the
substrate into smaller molecules. These smaller molecules diﬀuse into the fungus, where
they are used to allow growth and repair.
Fungi which feed on living cells are parasitic. For example, athlete's foot grows on the
human foot. These kinds of fungi produce hyphae called haustoria, which can penetrate
host cells without immediately killing them.
However, they are friendlier species of fungi. Many fungi live symbiotically with plants or
animals. For example, most trees have fungi living in close contact with their roots. In this
relationship, known as a mycorrhiza, there are many beneﬁts:
• Growing around the plant roots and often entering plant cells, the hyphae absorb minerals
from the soil and release them in the roots. The fungi gets its source of food (organic
nutrients) while delivering food to the plant.
• The mycelium here would increase the surface area, thus the absorptive surface, of the
plant roots.
• The fungal cells help to maintain air and water ﬂow in the soil around the roots.
• The fungi may prevent other potentially pathogenic fungi to attack the tree.
23.25 Fungal Reproduction
Fungi can reproduce in two ways. Firstly, they make asexually produce through frag-
mentation. This occurs when pieces of hyphae are broken oﬀ, which then grow into new
mycelia.
The second method is by spores. Spores are lightweight structures and windblown designed
to be transported over long distances and by many mediums, such as on the bodies of insects
and birds. They are additionally light enough to be blown away for hundreds of kilometers.
Spores may be asexual and sexual. Their sexual properties can be analysed to classify the
four phylla of fungi.
112Types of Fungi
23.26 Types of Fungi
23.26.1 Zygospore Fungi (Zygomycetes)
This phyllum includes bread moulds and other saprotrophs. Comparable to bacteria, this
phyllum prefers asexual reproduction over sexual reproduction.
1. Two haploid hyphae of opposite types, also known as mating strain + and mating
strain -, combine and fuse together.
2. Plasmogamy, the union of the two parent hyphae, occurs and results in the creation
of a heterokaryotic (n + n) zygosporangium or zygospore. Note that the zygospore is
NOT diploid yet; the haploid nuclei are simply clumped together.
3. Immediately, a thick wall develops around the zygospore to protect it from drying and
other hazards. The zygospore becomes dormant.
4. When conditions are favourable, the zygospore absorbs water and undergoes karyogamy
(n + n = 2n), where the haploid nuclei contributed by the two parents fuse to produce
diploid zygosporangia.
5. The now diploid zygosporangium then undergoes meiosis to form haploid sporangia.
6. Through asexual reproduction of fungi (See above for more information), the spores from
the sporangia germinate and grow into new mycelia.
7. Back to step #1.
23.26.2 Club Fungi (Basidiomycetes)
This phyllum increases mushrooms and shelf fungi. In many ways, the reproduction stages
of this phyllum is similar to that of zygomycetes.
1. Two haploid hyphae of opposite types, also known as mating strain + and mating
strain -, combine and fuse together.
2. Plasmogamy takes place, and a dikaryotic mycelium forms. The dikaryotic mycelium
grows faster then the haploid parental mycelia.
3. Environmental factors cause the dikaryotic mycelium to form compact masses which de-
velop into basidiocarps, short-lived reproductive structures. An example is the mushroom.
4. The basidiocarp gills are lined with terminal dikaryotic cells called basidia, which then
undergo karyogamy.
5. The basidia are now diploid. They undergo meiosis to develop haploid basidiospores, a
term referring to a basidiomycete's spores.
6. Stillremainingonthebasidiocarp, thehaploidbasidiosporeseject,fallfromthebasidiocarp,
and are dispersed by the wind when mature.
7. In a favourable environment, the basidiospores germinate and grow into short-lived
haploid mycelia.

23.27 Key Terms
synapomorphy
23.28 Introduction
What makes an animal an animal?
If animals are a monophyletic taxon, then animals should be able to be deﬁned by synapomor-
phies, (shared, derived characteristics). Ideally, we would NOT deﬁne this or any taxon using
symplesiomorphies (shared ancestral or primitive characteristics) or homoplastic characters
(the independent evolution of similarity, or "convergent evolution"). See pages 654 - 656 and
Fig. 32.6 in your text to review these concepts. As you consider the characteristics listed
below, ask yourself whether or not each is a synapomorphy.
23.29 Characteristics of an Animal
• There is no one universally accepted deﬁnition of an animal. The following treatment
follows your text, beginning on page 876.
• Animals:
• Are multicellular, heterotrophic eukaryotes ...
• Lack the distinctive cell walls of plants & fungi
• Share unique characteristics ...
• Share certain reproductive characteristics ...
• Other commonly used deﬁnitions ...
Animals are multicellular heterotrophic eukaryotes
• Unfortunately, none of these traits is exclusive to animals:
• Plants, fungi, and some algae are multicellular.
• Many bacteria, protists, and all fungi are heterotrophic.
• Everything other than bacteria and archaea are eukaryotic.
• Moreover, all three of these characteristics also apply to fungi.
• However, there is a diﬀerence here between animals and fungi. Animals generally
take in their food through ingestion, or eating and swallowing something. Fungi are
absorptive heterotrophs; they secrete their digestive enzymes onto their food, and then
absorb the resulting nutrients.
Animals share unique characteristics
• Only animals have muscle tissue and nervous tissue.
• Only animals have collagen, a structural protein
• Only animals have the following types of intercellular junctions: (See pages 135 - 139,
Figure 7.15 in your text for more information on these junctions.)
114Characteristics of an Animal
• Tight junctions (sealing function)
• Desmosomes (anchoring function)
• Gap junctions (communication function)
Animals share certain reproductive characteristics
• Most animals reproduce sexually, with the diploid stage dominating.
• In most animals, a small, haploid, ﬂagellated, motile sperm fertilizes a larger, haploid,
nonmotile egg to form a diploid zygote.
• Mitotic division of the zygote yields a blastula stage, followed by a gastrula stage. A
synapomorphy? This feature could be another "unique characteristic" shared by animals.
• Development may be direct to adult form, or there may be a sexually immature stage
(or stages) that are morphologically & ecologically distinct from the adult called a larva
(plural: larvae).
Other commonly used deﬁnitions or characterizations
• It is surprisingly diﬃcult to ﬁnd two texts that agree on a precise deﬁnition of an animal.
Here are a few perspectives from some other texts.
• Animals are multicellular eukaryotes; they are chemosynthetic heterotrophs that ingest
their food.
• Animals are motile, though many are secondarily sessile. Gametes usually are produced
inmulticellularsexorgans, andthezygotepassesthroughembryonicstagesthatinclude
a blastula.
• Animals are organisms that are multicellular, with more than one type of cell. They
are heterotrophic. They reproduce sexually (at least sometimes), with a zygote formed
from two diﬀerent haploid gametes. They go through a developmental stage called a
blastula.
• Animals are not photosynthetic, have no cell wall, and no hyphae or mycelia. (What
would a cladist think of this deﬁnition of the taxon Animalia?)
What kinds of animals are there?
• Kingdom Animalia generally is recognized to have approximately 30 phyla ...
• There is relatively little dispute over the number of phyla recognized; however, the
phylogenetic relationships among the phyla are hotly debated.
• Molecular techniques for assess similarity based on nucleotide sequences in nucleic
acids are providing valuable new perspectives on this question.
• Remember that two animals in diﬀerent phyla generally are considered to be more diﬀerent
from each other than are animals within one phylum (e.g., nematodes are more diﬀerent
from annelids than humans are from sharks).

23.31 Phylum Porifera
Figure 6 Sponges
Name means "pore-bearing".
This phylum consists of the sponges. The number of species is estimated to be between
5,000 and 10,000. All are aquatic and almost all are marine.
Animals in this phyla have no true tissues, which means, for example, that they have no
nervous system or sense organs. Although sponges are multicellular, they are described as
being essentially at a cellular level of organization. They are sessile as adults, but have a
free swimming larva.
Their bodies are porous. They are ﬁlter feeders; water ﬂows in through many small openings,
and out through fewer, large openings. They have inner and outer cell layers, and a variable
middle layer. The middle layer often is gelatinous with spiny skeletal elements (called
spicules) of silica or calcium carbonate, and ﬁbres made of spongin (a form of collagen).
117Multicellular Photosynthetic Autotrophs
Choanocytes are ﬂagellated cells lining the inside of the body that generate a current, and
trap and phagocytize food particles.
Their cells remain totipotent, or developmentally ﬂexible: they can become any type of
cell at any point in the sponge's development. This allows for the great regenerative power
sponges have.
Sponges are an ancient group, with fossils from the early Cambrian (ca. 540 mya) and
possibly from the Precambrian. Sponges often are abundant in reef ecosystems. They
somehow are protected from predators (spicules? bad taste?).
Many organisms are commensals of sponges, living inside them. Some sponges harbor
endosymbiotic cyanobacteria or algae (dinoﬂagellates, a.k.a. "zooxanthellae").
23.32 Phylum Cnidaria
See text pages 886 - 889.
Name comes from the Greek knide- meaning "nettle".
This phylum They have one opening, which serves as both mouth and anus. The body wall
has an outer ectoderm, an inner endoderm, and a variable undiﬀerentiated middle layer
called mesoglea or mesenchyme that may be jelly-like. The mesoglea is NOT considered
to be true mesoderm and so the Cnidaria are described as diploblastic. Tentacles usually
extend from the body wall around the mouth/anus.
118Phylum Cnidaria
Figure 7 Jellyﬁsh Development
14 15
There are two basic body plans: the polyp and the medusa . The polyp is sessile and
attaches to substrate by the aboral end (i.e., the end away from the mouth). The medusa
("jellyﬁsh") is a ﬂoating form, and looks like an upside-down version of the polyp. Some
cnidarians only have the polyp stage, some have only the medusa stage, and others have
both.
14 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polyp
15 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medusa%20%28biology%29
119Multicellular Photosynthetic Autotrophs
The typical life cycle of a cnidarian involves what is called "alternation of generations": an
alternation between an asexual polyp stage and a sexual medusa stage.
The tentacles are armed with cnidae (or nematocysts), small intracellular "harpoons" that
function in defense and prey capture. When ﬁred, the cnidae deliver a powerful toxin that
in some cases is dangerous to humans. The phylum is named after the cnidae.
Cnidarians have no head, no centralized nervous system, and no specialized organs for gas
exchange, excretion, or circulation. They do have a "nerve net."
Many cnidarians have intracellular algae living within them in a mutualistic symbiotic
relationship (Dinoﬂagellates = zooxanthellae). This combination is responsible for much of
the primary productivity of coral reefs.
There are three main classes in the phylum
16
• Class Hydrozoa (hydras and Portugese man-of-war are well-known but atypical examples
of this Class)
17
• Class Scyphozoa (jellyﬁsh)
• The medusa stage is dominant and the polyp stage often is reduced.
18
• Class Anthozoa (sea anemones, most corals)
• No medusa (jellyﬁsh) stage, so sexual reproduction occurs in the polyp stage in this
group. The polyps also can reproduce asexually, which is how individual "corals" grow.
23.33 Phylum Platyhelminthes
See text pages 890 - 893.
Name means "ﬂat worm"
Most members of this phylum are parasitic (ﬂukes and tapeworms), but some are free living
(e.g., planaria). There are about 20,000 species.
They are dorsoventrally compressed (i.e., "ﬂat").
Animals in this phylum are acoelomate, triploblastic, bilaterally symmetrical, and unseg-
mented. Platyhelminths have a simple anterior "brain" and a simple ladder-like nervous
system. Their gut has only one opening. Flatworms have NO circulatory or gas exchange
systems. They do have simple excretory/osmoregulatory structures (protonephridia or "ﬂame
cells").
Platyhelminths are hermaphroditic, and the parasitic species often have VERY complex
reproductive (life) cycles.
There are four main classes of platyhelminths:
19
• Class Turbellaria (mostly free living ﬂatworms, e.g., planaria)
16 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrozoa
17 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scyphozoa
18 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthozoa
19 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbellaria
120Phylum Rotifera
20
• Class Monogenea (parasitic ﬂukes)
21
• Class Trematoda (parasitic ﬂukes, e.g., liver ﬂuke and the human blood ﬂuke, Schisto-
soma)
22
• Class Cestoda (tapeworms)
• Cestodes are endoparasitic in the gut of vertebrates. They do not have a mouth or
digestive system.
23.34 Phylum Rotifera
See text page 900
The Rotifers. The name means "wheel bearing," a reference to the corona, a feeding structure
(see below).
They are triploblastic, bilaterally symmetrical, and unsegmented. They are considered
pseudocoelomates.
Most less than 2 mm, some as large as 2 - 3 mm.
Rotifers have a three part body: head, trunk foot. The head has a ciliary organ called the
corona that, when beating, looks like wheels turning, hence the name of the phylum. The
corona is a feeding structure that surrounds the animal's jaws. The gut is complete (i.e.,
mouth & anus), and regionally specialized. They have protonephridia but no specialized
circulatory or gas-exchange structures.
Most live in fresh water, a very few are marine or live in damp terrestrial habitats. They
typically are very abundant. There are about 2,000 species.
Parthenogenesis, where females produce more females from unfertilized but diploid eggs, is
common. Males may be absent (as in bdelloid rotifers) or reduced. When males are present,
sexual and asexual life cycles alternate. Males develop from unfertilized haploid eggs and
are haploid. Males produce sperm by mitosis which can fertilize haploid eggs, yielding a
diploid zygote that develops into a diploid female. Sexual reproduction occurs primarily
when living conditions are unfavorable.
Most structures in rotifers are syncytial ("a mulitnucleate mass of protoplasm not divided into
separate cells," or "a multinucleated cell") and show eutely (here, "constant or near-constant
number of nuclei").
23.35 Phylum Nematoda
See text pages 894 - 895.
Name from the Greek for "thread".
20 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monogenea
21 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trematoda
22 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cestoda
121Multicellular Photosynthetic Autotrophs
This phylum consists of the round worms. There are about 12,000 named species but the
true number probably is 10 - 100 times this!
These animals are triploblastic, bilaterally symmetrical, unsegmented pseudocoelomates.
They are vermiform, or wormlike.
In cross-section, they are round, and covered by a layered cuticle (remember this cuticle !!).
Probably due to this cuticle, juveniles in this phylum grow by molting. The gut is complete.
They have a unique excretory system but they lack special circulatory or gas-exchange
structures. The body has only longitudinal muscle ﬁbers. The sexes are separate.
Nematodes can be incredibly common, widespread, and of great medical and economic
importance. They are parasites of humans and our crops. They can live pretty much
anywhere.
In one rotting apple, there can be up to 90,000 nematodes, and in one tablespoon of coastal
mud, there can be 236 species of nematodes!
Nematodes can be free living or important parasites of our crops, or of humans and other
animals. They have become very important in development studies, especially the species
Caenorhabditis elegans, presumably due to its small size and constancy of cell number
(eutely - 959 cells in C. elegans).
23.36 Phylum Annelida
See text pages 906 - 909.
Name means "ringed", from the Greek annulatus.
This phylum consists of earthworms, leeches, and various marine worms given many diﬀerent
names (e.g., sand worms, tube worms). There are about 12,000 - 15,000 species.
Animals in this phylum are triploblastic, bilaterally symmetrical, segmented coelomates.
Development is typically protostomous. They have a complete circulatory system, and
a well-developed nervous system. Typically, each segment has paired epidermal "bristles"
(setae or chaetae).
Most are marine but they are successful occupants of almost anywhere suﬃcient water is
available. They can be free living, parasitic, mutualistic, or commensalistic.
Major advances of this phylum include the true coelom, segmentation, both longitundinal
and circular muscles, a closed circulatory system and, for most, a more advanced excretory
system (metanephridia).
There are three main classes of Annelids
• Class Oligochaeta (earthworms)
• Class Polychaeta (marine worms)
• Class Hirudinea (leeches)
122Phylum Arthropoda
23.37 Phylum Arthropoda
Figure 8 Arthropods
Name means "jointed feet".
This phylum consists of spiders, ticks, mites, insects, lobsters, crabs, and shrimp, and is the
largest of all the phyla. So far, over 1 million species have been named, and it is likely that
the true number out there is 10 - 100 times greater.
This phylum also includes the extinct trilobites, which were prevalent in the Paleozoic era.
Because of their exoskeletons, these animals fossilized well and over 4000 species have been
named.
These animals are triploblastic, bilaterally symmetrical, segmented, protostome coelomates.
The coelom is generally reduced to portions of the reproductive and excretory systems. They
have an open circulatory system.
Themostnotableadvancementofthisphylumisarigidexoskeleton. Ithasmajorimplications
in these organisms' locomotion, ﬂexibility, circulatory systems, gas exchange systems, and
growth. It also was partially responsible for the ability of the arthropods to move on to land.
There are several major groupings of arthropods:
Major subgroups include:
• The chelicerates (eurytperids, horseshoe crabs, scorpions, spiders, ticks) have clawlike
feeding appendages. They lack antennae and usually have simple eyes.
• The Trilobites...they get their own grouping
123Multicellular Photosynthetic Autotrophs
• The uniramians (centipedes, millipedes, insects) have one pair of antennae and un-
branched (uniramous) appendages.
• The crustaceans (crabs, shrimp, lobsters, barnacles and many others) have two pairs of
antennae and branched (biramous) appendages.
Major Classes Include
• Class Arachnida (mites, scorpions, spiders, ticks)
• Class Diplopoda (millipedes)
• Class Chilopoda (centipedes)
• Class Insecta (insects)
• Class Crustacea (crabs, crayﬁsh, lobsters, shrimp)
23.38 Phylum Mollusca
See text pages 900 - 905.
Name means "soft".
This phylum consists of snails, slugs, bivalves, chitons, squids, octopus, and many others.
About 110,000 species
All molluscs have a similar body plan:
• A muscular foot, usually used for movement.
• A visceral mass, containing most of the internal organs.
• A mantle, a fold of tissue that drapes over the visceral mass and secretes the shell, if
present.
• Most have a radula, or a rasping organ to scrape food.
Molluscs are bilaterally symmetrical, or secondarily asymmetrical. They are coelomates, but
the coelom generally has been greatly reduced; the main body cavity is a hemocoel. Devel-
opment is typically protostomous. The gut is complete with marked regional specialization.
Large, complex, metanephridia (excretion).
Many molluscan life cycles include a trochophore larva. This stage also is characteristic of
annelids.
There are several major classes of molluscs:
• Class Polyplacophora (chitons)
• Class Gastropoda (snails, slugs, nudibranchs)
• Class Bivalvia (clams, mussels, scallops, oysters)
• Class Cephalopoda (squids, octopuses, chambered nautiluses)
23.39 Phylum Echinodermata
Name means "spiny skin"
This phylum consists of sea stars, brittle stars, sea urchins, and sea cucumbers.
124Phylum Chordata
Echinoderms are mostly sessile or very slow moving animals.
As adults, they are radially symmetrical, but in the larval stage, they are bilaterally
symmetrical. They are considered deuterostomes.
Echinoderms are unique in that they have a water vascular system composed of a system
of ﬂuid-ﬁlled canals. These canals branch into the tube feet, which function in feeding,
locomotion, and gas exchange.
There are six major classes of echinoderms:
• Class Asteroidea (sea stars)
• Class Ophiuroidea (brittle stars)
• Class Echinoidea (sea urchins, sand dollars)
• Class Crinoidea (sea lilies)
• Class Holothuroidea (sea cucumbers)
23.40 Phylum Chordata
Name means "the chordates", i.e., these animals have a notochord at some stage in their
lifecycle.
This phylum consists of tunicates, lancelets, and the vertebrates.
There are four major features that characterize the phylum Chordata.
• A notochord, or a longitudinal, ﬂexible rod between the digestive tube and the nerve
cord. In most vertebrates, it is replaced developmentally by the vertebral column. This
is the structure for which the phylum is named.
• A dorsal hollow nerve cord which develops from a plate of ectoderm that rolls into a tube
located dorsal to the notochord. Other animal phyla have solid nerve cords ventrally
located. A chordate nerve cord splits into the central nervous system: the brain and
spinal cord.
• Pharyngeal slits, which allow water that enters through the mouth to exit without
continuing through the entire digestive tract. In many of the invertebrate chordates,
these function as suspension feeding devices; in vertebrates, they have been modiﬁed for
gas exchange, jaw support, hearing, and other functions.
• A muscular, postanal tail which extends posterior to the anus. The digestive tract of
most nonchordates extends the length of the body. In chordates, the tail has skeletal
elements and musculature, and can provide most of the propulsion in aquatic species.
Chordates have a segmented body plan, at least in development. This segmentation evolved
independently from the segmentation of annelids.
Three subphyla make up the phylum Chordata:
• Subphylum Urochordata (tunicates): the adults are enclosed in a tunic made of a carbo-
hydrate much like cellulose. They squirt water out of an excurrent siphon. Urochordates
are characterized by errant (mobile and active) larvae and sessile adults. All are ﬁlter
feeders. The only "chordate" characteristics retained in adult life are the pharyngeal slits.
125Multicellular Photosynthetic Autotrophs
Larval urochordates look more like adult cephlochordates & adult vertebrates than adult
urochordates.
• Subphylum Cephalochordata: Cephalochordates are known as lancelets because of their
blade-like shape; they are also known as amphioxus. They are marine animals and usually
live on the bottom, but can swim.
• Subphylum Vertebrata (vertebrates) ...
Formally, the phyla Urochordata and Cephalochordata are considered invertebrates.
23.40.1 Subphylum Vertebrata
Vertebrata refers to the presence of vertebrae and a vertebral column.
This subphylum includes most of the animals with which most people are familiar.
Vertebrates show extreme cephalization.
The notochord generally is replaced by the cranium & vertebral column in adults.
Neural Crest Cells
Later in development, these give rise to many cells of the body, including some cartilage
cells, pigment cells, neurons & glial cells of the peripheral nervous systems, much of the
cranium, and some of the cells of the endocrine system.
Some scientists would like to classify the neural crest as the fourth germ layer.
Neural crest cells come from the dorsal edge of the neural plate, thus ectoderm.
12624 Chordates
The phylum Chordata includes three subphyla. These include vertebrates and invertebrate
chordates.
24.1 Characteristics
Notochord: the rod-shaped supporting axis found in the dorsal part of the embryos of all
chordates, including vertebrates
Flexible, non-collapsible rod dorsal to the gut/coelom and below the nervous system,
hydrostatic, ﬂuid wrapped in tough connective tissue. As bone does not compact, muscles
tensed on one side result in movement instead of shortening the animal. This allows much
better locomotion than do cilia for larger animals in water, a crucial victory for later success.
Pharyngeal slits: Slits in the pharynx originally used to gather food, water enters the mouth,
passes through pharynx and out gill-like slits, passing through a cavity called an antrium
and then outside. In humans, present only in embryo.
Dorsal nerve cord: A neural tube dorsal to the notochord
Postanal tail: Elongation of the body and notochord, nerve cord and muscles past anus into
tail, early locomotive function led to success.
Non-synapomorphic characteristics (not limited to chordates):
• bisymmetrical (bilateral symmetry)
• segmented muscles and bones
24.2 Subphylum Urochordata
The tunicates are located in this subphylum. Along with the subphylum Cephalochordata,
these two subphyla make up the invertebrate chordates. Only the tunicate larvae have
notochords, nerve cords, and postanal tails. Most adult tunicates are sessile, ﬁlter-feeders
which retain their pharyngeal slits. Adult tunicates also develop a sac, called a tunic,
which gives tunicates their name. Cilia beating within the turnicate cause water to enter
the incurrent siphon. The water enters the body, passes through the pharyngeal slits,
and leaves the body through the excurrent siphon. Undigested food is removed through
the anus. Tunicates are hemaphrodites and can reproduce asexually through budding.In
urochordates notochord is conﬁned to larval tail.These lack cranium. These have an open
type of circulatory system.Excretion is by neural gland,nephrocytes.
127Chordates
24.3 Subphylum Cephalochordata
The lancelets are located in this subphylum. Along with the subphylum Urochordata, these
two subphyla make up the invertebrate chordates. Lancelets receive their name from their
bladelike shape. They resemble ﬁsh but they are actually scaleless chordates only a few
centimeters long. They spend most of their time buried in the sand with their mouths
protruding. Fossils of lancelets have been found to be over 550 million years old.
Dropped out sessile stage, what was the larval stage is now sexually reproductive. Includes
Branchiostoma (“amphioxus”).
24.4 Subphylum Vertebrata
(Vertebra from Latin vertere, to turn). Characterized by separate bones or cartilage blocks
ﬁrmly joined as a backbone. The backbone supports and protects a dorsal nerve cord.
Vertebrates have tissues which are organized into organs which in turn are organized into
organ systems.
All vertebrates share the following characteristics: - segmentation - a true coelom - bilateral
symmetry-cephalization-abackbone-abonyskull-aclosedcirculatorysystem-chambered
heart - two pairs of jointed appendages - tissues organized into organs
Vertebrate Organ Systems: - Nervous System - Circulatory System - Digestive System -
Respiratory System - Reproductive System - Excretory System
• Vertebral column: Not present in higher vertebrate adults. (In humans, the gel-like,
spongy core of the vertebral column is the only remainder. Ruptured or herniated disc is
an injury to this.)
• Cranium: Composite structure of bone/cartilage. Two functions: 1. Supports sensory
organs of head and 2. Encloses or partially encloses the brain.
What evolutionary relationship could we imagine between sessile echinoderms and the higher
chordate animals?
Paedomorphic (child-form) hypothesis: basically, evolution of sexual reproduction in what
had previously been a larval life stage, or the retention of at least one juvenile characteristic
into the adult (adult = sexually reproducing) stage. Some scientists believe that this occurred
in a proto-chordate animal lineage. Maybe chordates (and vertebrates) arose from sessile
(attached) ancestors. Selection in these proto-chordates maybe began to favor more time in
the larval stage, as feeding was more successful or mortality lower in this stage. As larvae
got bigger physics shows that the cilia become less eﬃcient for locomotion, favoring the
undulating motion allowed by a notochord.
Is this hypothesis crazy? A similar example of this today is Epemeroptera, the mayﬂy, which
has almost abandoned its adult stage. Its one-year lifespan is mostly larval with just a brief
day of reproduce-and-die as an adult, which doesn’t even have usable mouthparts.
Tunicate (sea squirt) larva has all four chordate characteristics, although adult sessile
(“attached”).
128Subphylum Vertebrata
24.4.1 Class Agnatha
"jawless ﬁsh"
• Ostracoderms: extinct Agnathans which had primitive ﬁns and massive plates of bony
tissue on their body.
• Cyclostomes: "circle mouth" - a group of Agnathans which is still alive in the form of
lampreys and hagﬁsh.
Appeared approximately 500 million years ago and dominated the oceans for about 100
million years. The ﬁrst group of ﬁsh to appear. They had neither jaws, paired ﬁns, nor
scales, but they were the ﬁrst organisms with a backbone.
Class Acanthodia
"spiny ﬁsh" Appeared about 430 million years ago. An extinct class of ﬁsh that developed
jaws with bony edges. They had internal skeletons made of cartilage and some bone.
Class Placodermi
Appeared about 410 million years ago, dominated the sea for about 50 million years. An
extinct class of ﬁsh with massive heads.
24.4.2 Class Chondrichthyes
"cartilaginous ﬁsh" Appeared about 400 million years ago with bony ﬁsh. Includes sharks,
skates and rays, and chimaeras. Their skeletons are made of cartilage strengthened by the
mineral calcium carbonate.
The main characteristics and distinguishing features of this class: - gills - single-loop blood
circulation - vertebral column - presence of placoid scales on their bodies - internal skeleton
of cartilage - paired, ﬂeshy pectoral and pelvic ﬁns - asymmetrical tail ﬁn prevents sinking -
fatty liver provides neutral buoyancy - visceral clefts present as separate and distinct gills -
no external ear - oviparous - internal fertilization - ectoderms - cold blooded
24.4.3 Class Osteichthyes
"bony ﬁsh" Appeared about 400 million years ago with cartilaginous ﬁsh. Includes about
95% of today's ﬁsh species.
Subclass Sarcopterygii
ﬂeshy-ﬁnned ﬁshes. Fins have bones and muscles, homologous to our limbs.
Order Dipnoi
lung ﬁshes, two groups isolated when continents separated
129Chordates
Order Crossopterygii
includes coelacanths and rhipodistians, gave rise to amphibians, had lungs which evolved
into a swim bladder in bony ﬁshes, and labyrinthodont teeth, characterized by complex
folding of enamel.
• Skeleton made of bone, jaws, ﬁns, most with scales, two-chambered heart.
24.4.4 Class Amphibia
means “both lives”, aquatic larvae, terrestrial adult Amphibians: - Legs - Lungs - Double-
Loop Circulation - Partially Divided Heart - Cutaneous Respiration (Breathes through
Skin)
Order Salientia
frogs (jumping) (aka Anura)
Order Urodela
salamanders (tailed)
Labyrinthodont amphibians: oldest known amphibians, inherited characteristic teeth from
crossopterygii ancestor, had stocky, aquatic larvae.
Amphibians have limbs instead of ﬁns. Girdles and vertebral column now more substantial
and connected, support body on legs.
Lisamphybia: no scales, “smooth”, eggs with no shell, laid in water (water-reliant).
Amphibians gave rise to cotylosaurs, from which arose dinosaurs, turtles, lizards, and
therapsids.
Class Reptilia
amniotic egg allowed freedom from water, shelled egg. (Amnion: protection). Reptiles have
four extra-embryonic membranes:
• Amnion: supports aquatic environment inside egg in ﬂuid sac.
• Allantois: allows gas exchange and elimination of wastes.
• Chorion: gas exchange
• Yolk sac: only one of the four left over from amphibian ancestor
Reptiles cold-blooded, or ectothermic, meaning that their heat come from their environment.
Sometimes deﬁned as all amniotes that are not birds or mammals.
Reptiles can be classiﬁed by skull structure into four groups:
• Anapsid
• Synapsid
• Diapsid
• Euryasid
130Subphylum Vertebrata
Refers to number of holes in the skull. Cotylosaurs had Anapsid skull
Dermatocranium: from bony outer skull structure, precursor to human cranium.
Subclass Anapsidia
Subclass Testudinata

turtles , terrapins
Subclass Diapsida
2 3
dinosaurs , snakes , most stuﬀ
Subclass Synapsida
Order Therapsids
Subclass Diapsida
includes Ichthyosaurs, marine reptiles convergent on dolphins; Plesiosaurs, ancient sea
monsters; Squamates, including lizards and snakes; and Thecodonts, which gave rise to
• birds
• dinosaurs
• crocodilians
Dinosaurs: broken into two groups, based on hip structure
• Saurischia: lizard hips (gave rise to birds [!]), ancestrally bipedal
• Ornithischian: bird hips, ancestrally quadripedal
Crocodilians: come from archosaurs, the only extant (still living today) archosaur descendant.
Ancestrally bipedal, secondarily quadripedal.
Synapsids: refers to joined (Greek syn-, together with) parts of skull. Led eventually to
mammals. Synapsid pelycosaur >> therapsid >> mammals
Pelycosaur: Sail-backed dinosaur, legs not spread out like lizard but more pillar-like and
under body, allowing greater activity and competence in motion, pendulum like rather than
constant push-up. Teeth diﬀerentiated into diﬀerent types, for pre-processing of food needed
by higher metabolism. Skull changes, bone histology, suggestions of warm-bloodedness.

131Chordates
Class Aves
arose late Jurassic, early Cretaceous. Feathers, skeleton modiﬁed for ﬂight. Feathers:
epidermal derivative, made of keratin (like ﬁngernails). Carpometacarpis: bears primary
ﬂight feathers, parallel to hand parts. Keeled sternum: breastbone, powerful one needed
to support ﬂight muscles. Strong, light, occasionally hollow bones. All birds lay eggs (as
contrasted to reptiles, which have developed live birthing over 100 independent times.) Why
are there no live-bearing birds? Early birds had teeth, lost them. With mammals, only
exothermic animals.
Archaeopteryx: “ancient wing”, Jurassic bird-reptile, very dinosaur-like. Good fossils found
in Zolenhoﬀen, German sandstone mine with ﬁne sand, shows feathers clearly, found shortly
after Darwin’s publication and used to support his hypothesis. Thick, heavy bones and no
sternum, bony tail, not a good ﬂyer but did have primary ﬂight feathers.
Archaeornithes: includes archaeopteryx.
Paleognathae: gave rise to Australian ﬂightless birds.
Neognathae: remaining live birds.
Class Mammalia
Two unique characteristics, or synapomorphies:
• Hair
• Mammary glands
(don’t fossilize well)
Three skeletal characteristics (fossilize)
• Lower jaw only one bone, the dentary (several in reptiles)
• Three bones in middle ear: malleus, incus, stapes (reptiles have one or two, never three)
• Joint between upper and lower jaws between dentary and squamosal of skull (in reptiles
this joint is between other bones)
Mammals basically have a synapsid skull design inherited from ancestor
Non diagnostic characteristics (not unique to mammals):
• Warm-blooded
• Skin glands: sweat glands and oil-producing sebaceous glands
• Large nasal cavities (because of high metabolism) Clean, warm and humidify air
• Heterodonty (diﬀerentiated teeth)
• Diphiodonty: two sets of teeth: baby and adult (“deciduous” teeth, drop out) (reptile
teeth are continually replaced)
Subclass Protheria
monotremes (Greek mon-, one; and trema, hole), or egg-laying mammals, have one opening
for excretion and urination.
132Subphylum Vertebrata
Subclass Theria
Metatheria: Marsupials (opossum, kangaroo...) Eutheria: Placental mammals (all common
mammals)
Marsupium: (from Greek marsypion, purse or pouch). Gestation period much shorter than
in Eutherian mammals, but after leaving the uterus the tiny oﬀspring crawls into a pouch
where it completes development latched onto a teat.
Recent molecular (read: genetic) evidence suggests that two diﬀerent mammal groups
may have developed live-bearing ability separately. Instead of being a “rough draft” for
placental-style live bearing, perhaps the marsupial pouch approach is another solution to
the same problem. Advantage: in tough times the parent can pitch out the oﬀspring and
increase its own chance of survival.
13325 Tissues and Systems
13526 Epithelial tissue
Comes from various sources, ectodermal or endodermal material. Cell sheet lines a
surface or body cavity. One side, called freesurface or Apical, is exposed to
• animal interior (forming the lumen) or
• exterior of its body cavity.
The other side rests on the basal layer.
Epithelial tissue is not penetrated by blood vessels.
Two categories:
• sheets
• glands
Classiﬁed on two features:
• simple, (a single layer of cells),
• stratiﬁed, (more than one cell layer.)
Cell shape at free surface:
• squamous (broad and ﬂat)
• cuboidal (spherish)
• columnar (tall and thin)
Simple squamous epithelium
usually lines body cavities and vessels,alveoli, glomeruli of kidney; in blood and lymph
vessels called endothelium; in body cavities called mesothelium (serosae): parietal serous
membranes line body wall, visceral serous membranes cover organ
Simple cuboidal epithelium
in ducts like kidney and salivary glands.
Simple columnar epithelium
nonciliated type lines digestive tract, ciliated type lines some regions of uterine tubes and
lungs
Stratiﬁed squamous epithelium
(important) lines mouth, esophagus,and vagina. Cells sometimes dead, ﬂat and keratinized,
making them resistant to abrasion. Stratiﬁed squamous epithelium changes to columnar
squamous epithelium progressively down esophagus to the stomach.
Epidermis
137Epithelial tissue
from epithelium. Below this is dermis, thicker and with blood vessels.
Two specialized epithelia:
• pseudostratiﬁed
• transitional
Pseudostratiﬁed epithelia
lines the trachea (where it is ciliated)and the male urethra (where it is non ciliated), looks
stratiﬁed but not.
Transitional epithelia
found only in bladder and urinary system. As it stretches it appears to go from 6 to 3 cell
layers deep.
Glandular epithelia
(gland: group of cells that excretes something.. mostly derived from epithelium. Glands
are classiﬁed into endocrine and exocrine by where they excrete.
Endocrine glands
secrete hormones into the blood without use of ducts.
Exocrine glands
secrete onto the body surface or into a cavity, thru a duct. Exocrine substances include
sweat, mucous, oil, and saliva. An exocrine gland is the liver, which secretes bile.
13827 Connective tissue
This is a “grab bag” category of diverse tissue types. Functions include binding and
supporting. Types include bone, cartilage, ﬁbrous connective tissue, blood and
adipose (fat) tissue.
If you took away everything in the body except the connective tissue, you’d still be able to
see the basic form of the body.
Form: distinctivecellssurroundedbyacellmatrixmadeofextra-cellularﬁbergrounded
in a ground substance (excluding blood)
Types:
1. connectile connective tissues (can be 1. loose or 2. dense)
2. special connective tissue (includes blood, bones and cartilage).
Fibroblasts form connective tissue proper;
chondoroblasts form cartilage;
osteoblasts form bone;
and blood is formed from various sources.
Ground substance: “unstructured” material that ﬁlls space between cells and contains
ﬁbers. Made of
1. interstitial ﬂuid (bathes cells)
2. proteoglycans (protein core with attached polysaccharides, glycoaminoglycans or GAGs
such as chondroitin sulfate, keratin sulfate, and hyalronic acid, whose consistency is syrupy
to gelatin-like)
3. cell-adhesion proteins (connect connective tissue cells to the ﬁbers).
Fibers of connective tissue:
139Connective tissue
1. Collagen (ﬂexible protein resistant to stretching, tensile strength, most abundant
protein in animals, white)
2. elastin (rubbery, resilient protein, in dermis, lungs, blood vessels, yellow when fresh)
3. andreticulin (like collagen).
Loose connective tissue: found beneath skin, anchors muscles,nerves etc. Include ﬁ-
broblasts, macrophages, mast cells,and adipose cells. Fibers include collagen and
elastic ﬁbers. Ground substance is “syrupy”. Adipose included.
Dense connective tissue: largely densely packed ﬁbers of collagen or elastin regularly
or irregularly arranged. Forms tendons and ligaments, coverings of muscles, capsules
around organs and joints, and dermis of skin.
Cartilage vs. bone
Feature Bone Cartilage
cell type osteocytes chondrocytes
ground substance calcium phosphate chondroitin sulfate
vascularization vascular avascular
micro architecture highly ordered less organized
units called osteons
ﬁbrous sheath peristeum perichondrium
Cartilage: There are three cartilage types:
1. hyaline cartilage
2. ﬁbrocartilage (ﬁbrous cartilage)
3. elastic cartilage
Hyaline cartilage: most widespread cartilage type, in adults forms articular surfaces of
long bones, rib tips, rings of trachea, and parts of skull. Mostly collagen, name refers to
glassy appearance. In embryo, bones form ﬁrst as hyaline cartilage, later ossiﬁes. Found
in tracheal rings. Few collagen ﬁbers.
Fibrous cartilage: have lots of collagen ﬁbers. Found in intervertebral discs, pubic
symphesis. Grades into dense tendon and ligament tissue.
Elastic cartilage: springy and elastic. Found in internal support of external ear and in
epiglottis, yellow when fresh.
Chondrocites (cartilage cells) rely on diﬀusion for nutrients, as cartilage has no direct
blood supply, and no enervation (nerves). Can be loaded with calcium salts.
140Subphylum Vertebrata
Bone: Specialized connective tissue, calcium phosphate arranged in highly ordered unit
called osteon, or Hyvercian system. Concentric rings around central canal with blood
vessels and enervation (nerves). Bone varied, not all vertebrate bone is even cellular. Our
concern: simple pattern for mammals.
Lacuna (spaces in which osteocytes found); canaliculi (little canals) bigger diagonal cells,
layers of bone called lamellae.
Three types of bone cells, ending in
-blast, (mend bone)
-cyte (fortify bone)
-clast (tear down bone)
Classiﬁed by
1. appearance (spongy vs. hard)
2. where found (outside or inside)
3. how it is formed (endochondral cartilage model forms ﬁrst and then is ossiﬁed, and
entramembranous, bone forms directly without cartilage precursor)
Example of endochondral bone formation: long bone begins to ossify from center shaft,
calciﬁed region expands and cuts oﬀ diﬀusion of nutrients as bone replaces cartilage. In
young mammals, secondary ossiﬁcation centers then form at bone ends, growth has stopped
by sexual maturity as all primary bone is ossiﬁed. In other animals, bones continue growing
throughout their lifetime.
Three types of intramembrous bone:
1. dermal bone
2. sessamoid bone
3. perichondral bone.
Dermal bone forms skull, shoulder/pectoral girdle, and integument, descended from dermal
armor of ancestor. Comes from mesoderm, in dermis of skin.
Sessamoid bones: form directly in tendons. Example: kneecap, also in wrist. Deals with
stress.
Perichondral bone means “around cartilage,” forms around cartilage or bone. Func-
tions in bone repair and in ossiﬁcation of endochondral bone.
141Connective tissue
Bone remodeling and repair: bone has mineral structure, and develops tiny fractures,
which, under stress, can lead to larger fractures. To combat this, bone is constantly replaced.
Osteoclasts channel through existing bone, tear down and leave behind osteoblasts
and lacuna, leaving osteocytes. Continually resets mineral structure of bone, and is
preventative maintenance.
When bone broken, callus forms in open ends, periosteum gives rise to new bone with
calcium and new bone matrix, leaves irregular mend. Later, osteoblasts continue ﬁxing over
time and slowly removing imperfection.
14228 Muscle tissue
Mesodermal in origin, muscle has several functions: supply force for movement,restrain
movement, proper posture, act on viscera (internal organs) for peristalsis (moving food
down digestive tract), give body shape, form sphincters, (such as in esophagus, between
stomach and intestine, large and small intestine, in anus), in sheets of muscles, aﬀect air
ﬂow in and out of lungs, line blood vessels and play vital role in circulation.
Secondary roles: heat production (shivering a specialized heat production to supplement
metabolism).
Muscles co-opted to other non-original functions: sharks detect electrical ﬁeld created by ﬁsh
muscles. Some ﬁsh formed electric organs, create current strong enough to repel predators
or stun prey. Other ﬁsh can use ﬁeld as “radar” to see things and communicate with other
animals. (Evolved independently in diﬀerent groups).
Diﬀerent classiﬁcations: by color, (red or white) location, nature of nervous system
control (voluntary or involuntary), embryonic origin, or by general microscopic ap-
pearance (striated, smooth, and cardiac.)
Striated muscle (or skeletal muscle): under voluntary control. Individual cells called
ﬁbers, grouped into fascicle. Myoﬁbrils founding one cell made of even smaller myoﬁl-
aments. Each striated cell very long and multi-nucleated. Fibers joined end to end to
form longer composite ﬁbers. Sarcomeres: repeating units make up myoﬁbrils. Two
kinds of myoﬁlaments, thick kind made up of myosin and thin of actin. Striations visible
in light microscope, smaller part only with electron microscope.
Cardiac muscle: occurs only in heart. Light banding visible under light microscope.
Each band short, principally mononucleate (occasionally dinucleate) often branched, joined
together with intercollated discs. Involuntary. Waves of contraction spread through intercol-
lated discs. Initiated by nerve stimulation or can originate in the heart itself (useful in heart
transplants.)
Smooth muscle: no striations visible with light microscope. Almost entirely visceral
function: digestion, sphincters, urogenital tracts, piloerectory muscles (make hairs stand up),
lungs. Non-voluntary control. Slow and sustained action. Each cell mononucleate, short,
fusiform (spindly) in shape, cells usually uniform in size.
Striated muscle contraction: Muscle broken into units called fascicles, in units of myoﬁbrils.
Repeating units called sarcomeres, consisting of two kinds of myoﬁlaments:
1. thick, myosin ﬁlament
2. thin, actin ﬁlament.
143Muscle tissue
Sarcomere: Thick and thin ﬁlaments interspersed in ordered grid.
Sliding ﬁlament theory: thick and thin ﬁlaments move past each other in opposite
direction, shortening length. Longer muscles contract more rapidly than short ones (see cell
bio for details).
Myosin molecule: two polypeptides twisted together with two globular heads at end.
Myosin ﬁlament: many slender myosin molecules together.
Actin ﬁlament: chain of actin single, tropomyosin strands with repeated globular
troponin, and with actin. All play role in muscle contraction. Myocin heads have sites
that bind to actin. Actin ﬁlaments have many regular sites that can bind to myosin.
Troponin has four sites:
1. one to bind myosin
2. one for actin
3. one for tropomyocin
4. one for calcium ions
Nerve signal reaches muscle, triggers release of chemical signal called neurotransmitter,
that diﬀuses across cell membrane (sarcolimic reticulum) and binds to receptors in it.
Receptor is acetylcholine, ACH. When there is enough nerve signal, the message travels
through t-line to sarcoplasmic reticulum to release calcium ions.
Lacking calcium, tropomyosin site blocked. In calcium, myosin binding sites exposed and
heads bind to actin molecules, delivering force to move ﬁbers in relation to each other.
Myocin head then interacts with ATP to get “recocked”, if myosin still exposed then it
ﬁres again and results in further muscle contration. If there is no further nerve signal,
sarcoplasmic reticulum sequesters Ca+ ions again and no recocking occurs.
Quirari (or curare): known from movies, used in South America, blocks acetylcholine
receptors in cell and causes skeletal paralysis. Victim dies of asphyxiation because he can’t
breathe.
Duchenne's muscular dystrophy: degeneration of sarcolema, plasma membrane of
muscle cell unable to release signal and quickly atrophies.
Fast and slow twitch ﬁbers: vertebrate muscle ﬁber. Terms relative within one group
of animals. Diﬀerences related to diﬀerences in enervation, type of myocin, and actin
activation.
Two parts of force generated by muscle: 1. active component 2. elastic component (energy
stored in muscle when stretched by gravity or another force. Stored in muscle elastic tissue
around tendons. Especially important in limb oscillation, like running, or trunk twisting,
like ﬁsh swimming. Up to 90% of stored elastic energy can be recovered.)
144Subphylum Vertebrata
How does a muscle match its power to its job? Two ways:
1. rate modulation, derived from frequency of nervous stimulation of muscle, force
increases as frequency of stimulation increases up to point of tetanus.
2. selective involvement of motor units, a given neuron enervates a ﬁxed number of
muscle cells, (a motor unit), and force is increased by recruiting more motor units. Motor
units may be small, such as in eye, or larger, like in leg muscle.
How do muscles grow stronger?
1. add more myoﬁlaments, increases cross sectional area by up to 50%, more little ratchets
working
2. proliferation in blood vessels and connective tissue around muscle
Muscle strength is relative to cross sectional area, not length. Not always feasible to add
more cross sectional area.
Pinnate ﬁbers: oriented obliquely (Y-shaped) to minimize muscle mass, in certain circum-
stances, like calf muscle. Spreads muscle out.
Velocity of shortening greater in long muscle than short. Why? Contraction tied to relation
between ﬁbers, and to total length of muscle. Both long and short muscles reach same
percentage of contraction in same unit time, but distance covered by the longer muscle is
greater.
Synergist muscles: muscles work together to produce motion in same general direction.
Bicep shares work with brachialis.
Antagonist muscles: muscles that oppose each other. Bicep pulls forearm in, triceps pulls
it back out.
Origin vs. insertion: origin is the end of the muscle that more ﬁxed in its attachment to
the body. The more movable end called insertion.
Fixators: muscles that act to stabilize a joint or lever system. Like upper arm when you
clench your ﬁst hard.
Flexors and extensors: applied mainly to limbs. Flexor bends one part relative to another
about limb, extensor straightens it.
Adductor and abductor: adductor draws a limb toward the ventral surface. Abductor
moves limb away from ventral surface. (Adduct: drawn toward; abduct: carry away).
14529 Vertebrate digestive system
Functions to break down food into molecules small enough to absorb, or pass across digestive
membrane.
Digestive tract: tube extending from lips of mouth to anus or cloacae in bird, reptile or
monotreme.
Lumanal glands: empty into inner body cavity (lumen: inner surface).
Tract divided into three main regions: 1. buccal cavity 2. pharynx 3. alimentary canal
Alimentary canal divided into four regions: 1. esophagus 2. stomach 3. small intestine 4.
large intestine
Accessory digestive glands, outside digestive tract proper, secrete into lumen of tract
through ducts. Includes the salivary glands, liver and pancreas.
Buccalcavity, whichincludespalateandtongue, developsfrominfoldingofstomadeum,
or second opening of blastula, whereas the rest of the digestive tract develops from the
primitive gut.
Teeth: capture and hold prey. In mammals in particular further process and break down
food into small particles, increasing surface area available for enzymatic action.
Tooth anatomy: 1. crown projects above gum, 2. root below gum, 3. enamel is outer
coating of crown, hardest surface in body, of epideral origin 4. dentin, below enamel,
bone-like and forms bulk of tooth, is harder than bone and contains nerves and blood vessels.
(Remember that mammals are heterodontic, with diﬀerent types of teeth).
Pharynx: air passage for adult, gill slits in embryo. Important in lower vertebrates, site of
gills. Features derived from pharyngeal region: ﬁrst pharyngeal pouch gives rise to parts
of the ear, other pouches give rise to various other structures.
Alimentary canal: epithelium lines lumen, glands secrete into lumen, longitudinal and
circular muscles help digestive movements (peristalsis).
Esophagus: tube carries food from mouth to stomach. Expands to ﬁt large bolus (lump
of chewed food). Secretes mucus for lubrication. Birds have crop for storage, enlargement
of esophagus.
Epiglottis: keeps food out of air tube, an evolutionary “kludge,” or ﬁx.
Stomach. Absorbs water, alcohol, nutrients, uses gastric juice with enzymes, mucous, HCl,
released by chief and parietal cells (release protein enzymes) in gastric pits. Rugae: folds
of stomach, disappear when full. Sphincter at both ends of stomach, control food passage.
Chyme: semi-digested food released to small intestine.
147Vertebrate digestive system
Small intestine: three regions, duodenum, jejunum, and ileum.
Duodenum site of most intestinal digestion. Jejunum and ileum do most of intestinal
absorption. Ileum ends with another sphincter, ileocolic valve or ileosecal valve. Structure:
Circular folds covered with villi (singular is villus).
Villi: ﬁnger-likecellular projections, covered withmicrovilli, tinyprojectionswhichincrease
surfacearea. Increasessurfaceareaby900x, speedsdigestion(breakdown)andabsorption
(taking in nutrients).
Large intestine: larger diameter, shorter length than small intestine. No villi. In mammals,
forms large gentle loop, colon, empties into straight region, rectum, empties into outside
world through anal sphincter. Colon: absorbs water left over, also absorbs vitamins released
by bacteria which live there (vitamin K).
Food: made up of 1. proteins, 2. fats, 3. carbohydrates 4. ﬁbrous material.
Digestive system breaks foods down. Proteins must be broken to amino acids to be
absorbed. Polysaccharides to monosaccharides, lipids to fatty acids and monoglyc-
erides to absorb.
Salivary glands in mouth, saliva contains mucous, salt and a few enzymes (amalase, begins
starch breakdown). Snake venom from oral gland, mixture of toxins and digestive enzymes.
Breaks down blood vessels and disables nervous system.
Stomach enzymes: released in inactive form, zymogene, converts to active form in lumen
of gut. Transformation is triggered by another enzyme, or the stomach’s low pH. Pepsin
secreted as pepsinogen (-ogen means primitive form). Stomach glands secrete up to two or
three liters a day of gastric juice, which is reabsorbed.
Chyme released to duodenum.
Small intestine has two major accessory glands: 1. pancreas 2. liver
Pancreas has endocrine and exocrine functions, releases large amounts of carbonate to
neutralize acidic chyme, as intestinal enzymes work in neutral pH, and stuﬀ to break down
lipids and starch (zymogens, like tripsin)
Liver releases bile. Bile made from cholesterol, stored in gall bladder, released in
duodenum, emulsiﬁes fats.
Emulsify: keeps fats in tiny drops, which are suspended, increasing surface area and action
of lipases. Protein and carbohydrates absorbed in intestine, taken to liver for processing.
Fatty acids go to lymphatic system
Appendix: vestigial remnant. Much variation in digestive systems within mammals:
herbivore, carnivore, insectivore, non-ruminant herbivore.
Rumen: four-chambered stomach of animals like cows (ruminant herbivores). Cellulose
resistant to digestion, rely on microorganisms to break down cellulose. Some bacteria,
protists and fungi can break down cellulose, almost no animals can. Bacteria break down
cellulose in rumen, to be taken back to the mouth to chew their cud (ruminate). Later cow
swallows to proceed with digestion. (Horses not like this).
148Subphylum Vertebrata
Coprophagy: rabbits and other animals eat their own feces for the nutritious products of
the cecum.
14930 Circulatory system
Circulatory system functions
1. Transportation
a. Respiration: gas exchange (O2 and CO2), overcomes limited rate
of
diﬀusion
b. Nutrition:<br>
c. Excretory: (remove metabolic wastes)<br>
2. Regulation
a. Transport hormones<br>
b. Regulate body temperature<br>
c. Protection<br>
i. Blood clotting<br>
ii. Immune system (carries white blood cells)
Vasodilation: allows heat loss across epidermis, as seen in elephant ears, takes more blood
to surface of body, sweating may accompany
Countercurrent heat exchange: used by dolphins in ﬁns to conserve heat in cold water.
Veins surround an artery, and blood returning to body absorbs heat from blood traveling
out from body to ﬁn, minimizing heat loss. Used by dogs in feet, etc.
Blood made of 1. plasma and 2. formed cellular elements (red and white blood cells,
and platelets).
Plasma makes up 55% of blood volume. Cellular elements make up the other 45%.
Plasma makeup: 90% water, 7-8% soluble proteins (albumin maintains blood osmotic
integrity, others clot, etc.) 1% electrolytes 1% elements in transit
Red blood cell (erythrocyte): contains hemoglobin, functions in oxygen transport. In
mammals, red blood cells lose nuclei on maturation, and take on biconcave, dimpled, shape.
No self repair, live 120 days. About 1000x more red blood cells than white blood cells.
About 7-8 micrometers in diameter.
151Circulatory system
Hematocrit: proportion of blood volume that is occupied by cells, about 43% in humans
on average. 48% for men and 38% for women.
White blood cells (leukocytes): Nucleated, about 10-14 micrometers in diameter, com-
monly amoeboid, escape circulatory system in capillary beds. Include basophils, eosinophils,
neutrophils, monocytes, B- and T-cell lymphocytes.
Platelets (thrombocytes) Membrane bound cell fragments in mammals, no nucleus. In
non-mammals, platelet role replaced by nucleated cells. Accumulate at site of broken blood
vessels, form clots. Bud oﬀ special cells in bone marrow. 1-2 micrometers in diameter. 7-8
day life span, 1/10 or 1/20 as abundant as white blood cells.
Arteries: carry blood away from heart. Smallest tubes called arterioles, feed blood to
capillaries.
Veins: return blood to heart. Smallest veins called venules.
Structure of arteries and veins, listed from inside (lumen) out: 1. epithelium (endothelium),
2. elastic connective tissue ﬁbers, 3. smooth muscle, 4. connective tissue. Arteries
have thicker elastic layer than do veins.
Capillaries, where exchange of materials occurs, are very thin and narrow, and red blood
cells pass through single ﬁle. Capillaries are tiny but numerous, and their total volume is
greater than that of supplying arteries.
Blood velocity drops in capillaries, picks back up in veins. Pressure highest in arteries, lower
in capillaries and arteries.
Osmotic pressure draws interstitial ﬂuid from blood in arterioles, but replaces it in venules.
One-way valves mean that blood can ﬂow only one way, works with residual blood pressure
and compression by skeletal muscles. Low pressure in thoracic cavity caused by breathing
also helps move blood.
Lymphatic system: part of the immune system, a one-way, or open, system. Takes up
interstitial ﬂuid not taken up by venules.
Lymphatic structures:
1. lymphatic capillaries
2. lymphatic vesicles
3. lymph nodes
4. lymphatic organs (spleen and thymus)
Lymph: movement in mammals through one-way valves, similar to blood movement in
veins. (Some non-mammals have lymphatic hearts of unknown embryonic origin. Frogs and
salamanders have several.) Lymph rejoins cardiovascular system into a large vein near the
heart via single large thoracic duct.
152Subphylum Vertebrata
As lymph passes through system, passes lymphocytes, second part of immune system.
Heart: pumps blood, design varies between animals. In adult mammal,four chambers form
two separate circulations
1. pulmonary circulation to and from lungs and
2. systemic circulation to and from tissues of body.
Everything in the heart comes in pairs: 2 atria, 2 ventricles (left and right).
Diagrams usually drawn as though animal were on its back.
Pattern of blood ﬂow through heart: blood returning from major veins (vena cava)
enters rightatrium, contraction there delivers blood to rightventricle through atricuspid
valve, one of atrial ventricular valves (AV valve). Contraction of right ventricle drives blood
through semi lunar valve into pulmonary circuit and to lungs.Blood return to heart in
pulmonary veins, is oxygenated. Goes to left atrium, which contracts and delivers blood
to left ventricleby way of aortic semi-lunar valve, then goes to systemic circulation.
Both atria and ventricles contract in unison, left is more powerful than right (to all system
vs. just lungs).
Systole: heart contraction, diastole: heart relaxed
Timing of heart contraction: ventricles rebound to relaxed shape (diastole), and semi-
lunar valves close. Both atria(singular: atrium) ﬁll with blood coming from pulmonary
and systemic circulations.Pressure rises in the atria and blood begins to move into the
ventricles.The atria then contract, forcing more blood into the ventricles. There is a pause,
then ventricles contract. This raises ventricle pressure, atrio-ventricular(AV) valves
shut and semi-lunar valves open, forcing blood from the left ventricle into the major arteries
and from the right ventricle into the aorta.
Control for this action doesn’t rely on nervous stimulation, has intrinsic rhythmicity, called
myogenic. This is the case in mammal as well as in mollusk hearts. Other animals have
neurogenic hearts that rely on nervous stimulation for heart action, originating in the
cardiac ganglion.
The rhythmicity of mammalian heart relies on the sino-atrial (SA)node, or pacemaker.
This is a phylogenic (based on evolutionary history) remnant of an early vertebrate heart
that had one more chamber than modern hearts.
How the heart contracts: waves of depolarization start in SA node and spread
through atria. Connectile tissue pauses the spread of depolarization at the atrial ventricular
node. Signal continued by bundle branches to lower ventricle, begins to stimulate
heart to contract. Contraction starts at bottom of heart at heart apex,then signals spread
through heart.
Medulla (in the brain) controls autonomic nervous system. (The medulla is part of
the brain, is continuous with the spinal cord, and controls involuntary actions of the
body). Sympatheticcardiacacceleratorconnectstospinalcord, usesnorepinephrine
to signal. Parasympathetic cardio-inhibitory center reaches heart through Vagus
153Circulatory system
nerve, usesacetylcholine to signal. Hyperpolarizes membrane to inhibit heart contraction.
(Autonomic nervous system: two parts working in contra to control from both sides.)
Dominant eﬀect here is inhibitory. If we cut Vagus nerve, heart rate promptly rises about
25 bpm.
15431 Respiratory system
In humans and other animals, for example, the anatomical features of the respiratory system
include airways, lungs, and the respiratory muscles.
Other animals, such as insects, have respiratory systems with very simple anatomical features,
and in amphibians even the skin plays a vital role in gas exchange.
Plants also have respiratory systems but the directionality of gas exchange can be opposite
to that in animals. The respiratory system in plants also includes anatomical features such
as holes on the undersides of leaves known as stomata.
In mammals, the diaphragm divides the body cavity into the
abdominal cavity: contains the viscera (e.g., stomach and intestines)
thoracic cavity: contains the heart and lungs.
Respiratory tree: terminates in alveolus, alveoli. Respiratory bronchioles branch into
alveolar ducts and into alveoli. Alveolus: microscopic air sacs, 300 million of these in human
lungs. Total surface area large. Gas diﬀuses micrometer, very tiny distance.
Nervous System
Composed of tissues designed to integrate sensory information and direct a coordinated
response to the environment.
1
Basic unit of the nervous system is the neuron , a highly specialized cell that uses both
electrical and chemical processes to communicate. Neurons "listen" to sensory organs or
other neurons, and can simultaneously "hear" from 1 to hundreds of inputs simultaneously.
Likewise, a neuron can "talk" to other neurons or cells that can create an action, like muscle
cells or glands.
Neurons are outnumbered in the nervous system by glia. Glia were once thought to only play
a supportive role in helping neurons survive; today we know that they also are important
participants in the communication process. Glial cells include astrocytes, ependymal cells,
and a cell that has a macrophage like function. There are also oligodendocytes and Schwann
cells that provide a myelin sheath.

155Respiratory system
31.1 Neuron structure
Figure 9 Neuron
• Dendrite will receive information from other axons
• Stoma is the neuron body and contains typical cell parts including the mitochondria and
nucleus. This is where neurotransmitters are synthesized.
• Axon hillock is where the cell body and the axon meet.
• Axon is surrounded by myelin.
• Contains nodes of Ranvier
Types of axons include unipolar, bipolar, pseudopolar.
Action potentials results from excitatory stimuli received from the dendrites that results
in a signal that travels down the axon. On the cellular level, there is a Na+ inﬂux via
channels causing a depolarization of the cell. Once those channels close, the slower opening
K+ channels will open resulting in hyperpolarization by the cell.
Synapses
Neurotransmitters allow a chemical signal to be sent from one neuron to the other. Neuro-
transmitters must bypass a physical gap called the synapse. Examples of neurotransmitters
include acetylcholine, epinephrine, and glutamate.
Example : Neuromuscular synapses
156Central nervous system
Circuits / Nuclei / Ganglia
31.2 Central nervous system
Central nervous system includes the brain and the spinal cord.
Brain There are four lobes of the brain.
• Frontal lobe - decision making
• Parietal lobe
• Temporal lobe
• Occipital lobe - vision
The areas of the brain are also dedicated to diﬀerent functions.
• Precentral gyrus
• Postcentral gyrus
Protection The CNS is protected by three layers - the pia mater, the arachnoid mater, and
the dura mater. Protection also comes from the circulation of cerebral spinal ﬂuid (CSF).
CSF helps to ﬂoat the brain and also provide nutrients to both the brain and the spinal
cord. CSF is synthesized from the choroid plexus of the lateral ventricles. In total, there are
four ventricles - 2 lateral ventricles, a 3rd, and 4th ventricle.
31.3 Peripheral nervous system
The peripheral nervous system is broken down into two sub-systems, the somatic nervous
system and the autonomic nervous system.
ANS - Autonomic Nervous System The ANS has two components - parasympathetic and
sympathetic.
The sympathetic nervous system is the "ﬁght or ﬂight" or fright response and results in an
increased heart rate, increased rate of breathing, and an elevated blood glucose level. There
is also decreased digestion. The second neurotransmitter is epinephrine. In this case, the
ﬁrst neuron is short and the second neuron is long.
The parasympathetic nervous system is the rest and digest system.
Drugs must be able to pass the blood brain barrier to have an eﬀect on the CNS. Drugs act
by aﬀecting the neuron and how likely it is to ﬁre an action potential.
Stroke occurs when there is a blood clot that goes to the brain and prevent blood ﬂow.
15732 Sensory systems
Categorized by
1. nature of stimulus, such as mechanical, chemicalor light stimulus, and
2. where stimulus received, such as outside (exteroceptors,such as the eye and
skin temp receptors) or insidebody (interoceptors, such as blood body tem-
perature receptors).
Transduction of sensory input into signal. Means to “carry across”,signal transduced, or
carried, from environment into nervous signal.
Three sensory processes we cover
1. taste and smell (chemoreception)
2. gravity and movement
3. light
32.1 Taste and smell (chemoreception)
Found in mammal nose and mouth, ﬂy feet, ﬁsh bodies, moth antennae.
Papilla: bumps on tongue, contain taste buds down between. Sweet, sour, salty and bitter.
Some act directly by ion channels, others act indirectly. Other “taste” sensations really
smell.
Smell: received in nasopharynx. Airborne molecules go into solution on moist epithelial
surface of nasal passage. Approximately 1000 genescode for sensory neuron receptors. “Fried
onions” odor not one receptor but a mixture of many odors registered in our mind as one.
Very sensitive, habituates rapidly (don’t notice a smell after a bit). Odor sensation has
relatively unﬁltered root to higher brain centers.
Snakes more chemosensory focused than us.
32.2 Response to gravity and movement
Registered in inner ear. Three semicircular canals loop in three planes at right angles
to each other, responsible for transduction of movement messages. Method: hair cells
159Sensory systems
deformed by gelatinous membrane. Vestibular apparatus, gives us perception of gravity
and movement. Due to physical response, not chemical binding.
Cochlea: bony, coil shaped part of inner ear, where hearing occurs.
Sound enters throughauditory canal, vibratestympanic membrane,moving three bones
of middle ear (malleus, incus, and stapes)against oval window opening in front of cochlea.
Cochlea has three ﬂuid ﬁlled ducts, one of these the organ of Corti. Sound waves in air
go to vibration in organ of Corti; ﬂuid tickles hair cells, which register the movement
along basilar membrane in cochlea. Diﬀerent sound frequencies move diﬀerent portions
of basilar membrane. Hearing loss due to loss of hair cells.Humans normally smell more
than 300 odors in a day(Facts and Truth).
Transduction of sound accomplished throgh physical deformation,not chemical binding.
32.3 Vision
Light enters pupil, focused by lensonto retina.
Sclera: hardened part behind retina.
Optic nerves and neurons attached to retina. Blind spot where optic nerve attaches, has
no receptors.
Two types of photoreceptors
1. rods - black and white low-light vision, 100 million in each retina in humans.
2. cones - color vision, work best under better illumination. 3 million in each retina.
Fovia: region of most acute vision, has most of the cones, few rods.
Transduction process of light to signal a molecular change, to light absorbing molecule
called photopigment. Located in outer parts of rods and cones in pigment discs. The rod
photopigment is called rhodopsin,cone has three photopigments, called photopsins. This
molecular change initiates pathways to result in action potential in downstream neuron
leading to vision center in brain.Parul Godika
Each of the three photopsins has a diﬀerent peak of sensitivity: blue,green or red, and
changes isometric form (from cisto trans) based on light from a particular wavelength
range. Color blindness:inherited lack of one or more types of these cones. Gene carried on X
chromosome, therefore more common in men than women.
32.4 Homeostasis
Is a very important part of everyone's and everything's lives. Deﬁned as dynamic con-
stancy of internal environment, maintenance of a relatively stable environment inside
an organism usually involving feedback regulation.
160Osmotic environments and regulations
Homeostasis is maintained in face of
1. a varying external environment, or
2. a non-ideal, constant external environment (as with the penguin).
Deals with temperature, pH, chemical concentrations,pressure, oxygen levels.
Occurs through negative feedback loops.
Various forms: simple thermostat in house turns oﬀ heater when above a certain temperature
and on when below a certain temperature Involves stimulus, sensor,integrating center,
eﬀector and response.
More eﬃcient control has two sensors and two eﬀectors. Can be antagonistic to each
other, such as, one cools, the other heats.
Precise control through proportional control, not all-or-none, furnace comes on a little
bit if the house a bit cold. Examples in humans: vasoconstriction, change in metabolic rate,
shivering. Physiological responses for high body temp: blood goes to body surface, sweating,
behavioral changes (get out of sun).
Positive feedback loop: eﬀector increases deviation from set point. Ampliﬁes reaction.
Like blood clotting process, uterine contraction during childbirth. Negative feedback must
exist at some point for control.
32.5 Osmotic environments and regulations
1. Marine invertebrates
a) fully marine invertebrates (not intertidal or estuarine) osmoconformers (set
internal environment same as environment, no net ﬂow of ions) in a stenohaline
(narrow non-changing salt level) environment
b) Coastal, intertidal, estuarine (ion levels ﬂuctuate) invertebrates.Partly osmo-
confomers, partly osmoregulators in a euryhaline (wide salt level variation)
environment (ex: shore crab, regulates sometimes when salt levels in environment
get real low).
2. Freshwater animals. Here, environment has lower solute concentrations than do
living organisms so water tends to ﬂow in and solutes out.
a) Freshwater ﬁsh (bony) dilute urine, and gills actively take up ions (NaCl)
b) Freshwater invertebrates: same situation as freshwater ﬁsh but with diﬀerent
structures
c) Freshwater amphibians: active uptake of salts across their skin
3. Marine ﬁshes: Here the environment has a higher solute concentration than does
the organism so water tends to ﬂow out and ions in.
a) Bony ﬁshes: actively secrete salts (NaCl) across gills, absorb water across gut
wall, their kidney (unlike mammalian kidney) is unable to generate concentrated
urine so glomerulus is reduced, active tubular secretion of MgSO
4
b) cartilaginous ﬁshes (and coelacanth): blood retains urea and trimethylamineoxide
to increase its osmolality to that of seawater
161Sensory systems
4. Terrestrial animals: here problem is loss of water to a drier environment, and
regulation of salt levels.
a) water loss adaptations
b) concentrated exception of salts and nitrogenous wastes
Hypoosmotic: having less osmotic potential than nearby ﬂuid
Hyperosmotic: having more osmotic potential than nearby ﬂuid
Isoosmotic: having equal osmotic potential than nearby ﬂuid
Glomerulus: reduces volume of kidney
Fish started in salt water, spread to fresh water, later reinvaded salt-water environment.
Terrestrial animal water sources:
1. drinking
2. moist foods
3. from breakdown of metabolic molecules like fats. (Desert kangaroo rats get 90% of their
water from metabolism.)
Secretion of nitrogenous wastes: from metabolism of amino acids, amino group has to be
removed in one of three basically interchangeable chemical forms:
1. ammonia (aquatic life)
2. urea (mammals)
3. uric acid (birds)
Ammonia very toxic, soluble, and cheap to produce. Easy to expel for bony ﬁshes.
Urea: low toxicity, good solubility, more costly to lose as it contains other groups on it.
Must be released in solution, water cost.
Uric acid (white part of bird poo) low toxicity, insoluble, secreted with little water loss,
more costly side groups lost than the others.
Mammalian kidney: Structure: ﬁst-sized organ in lower back. About 1/5 of blood from
aorta at any time is passing through kidneys. Blood passes through kidney many times a
day.
Nephron: structural and functional unit of kidney.
Bowmans capsule: funnel-like opening, contains primary ﬁlter, the glomerulus.
Proximal convoluted tubule: receives stuﬀ from Bowmans capsule.
Loop of Henle: descends and ascends.
162Osmotic environments and regulations
Vasa recta: capillaries that surround the Loop of Henle.
Glomerulus: main ﬁlter of the nephron, located within the Bowman's capsule
Kidney properties and processes important to its function
1. Active transport of solutes from one ﬂuid to another against a concentration gradient,
+
Na actively transported out of ﬁltrate by cells of the thick ascending loop of Henley into
the interstitial ﬂuid
2. Passive movement of solutes and water from one ﬂuid to another(down a concen-
tration gradient), movement of water and NaCl out of descending loop of Henley into
interstitial ﬂuid.
3. Diﬀerential permeability of cells in diﬀerent regions of the nephron to movement
of water and solutes, ascending thick look is impermeable to water, descending portion is
permeable to water
4. Hormonal control of that permeability, antidiuretic hormone(ADH) increases
permeability of collecting due to water, resulting in reduced volume of ﬁltrate and thus
more concentrated urine.
5. Increasing solute concentration in the interstitial ﬂuid of the kidney, from the
cortex to the deepest medulla, maintained by a countercurrent multiplier mechanism
